Google,"Aug 15, 2014",No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied online. The process took 8+ weeks. I interviewed at Google (Mountain View, CA) in July 2014.","Day 0 — I apply to seven different Software Engineer positions in the Bay Area simultaneously via their website.Day 0 — 38 minutes later, I receive an email from a Recruiter (call him R1), who's also an Engineering Manager (?). He asks when we can talk over the phone about ""matching me up with the right opportunities at Google."" I send a timestamp back.Day 2 — Phone call with R1, about ten minutes. He asks to tell him about myself, what my background is, what I'm interested in, why I want to work for Google, etc. He ends by telling me we'll set up a phone interview, which I intentionally schedule for a couple weeks later. (R1 asks me to choose a programming language for the interview, and mentions that he'll be sending me a syllabus to prepare.) Recruiting Coordinator 1 (RC1) emails me the details of the phone interview, which we confirm.Day 9 — Still no syllabus. I email R1. He sends me a verbatim excerpt from the Steve Yegge blog post you've already read.Day 15 — Phone interview day. 25 minutes into the schedule time slot, no call. I email RC1. Auto-reply: that account no longer exists. Great. I wait a bit longer. I give R1 a call; no answer, leave a voicemail. He replies within the hour, says he's sorry, asks for availability to reschedule. I reply.Day 23 — Phone interview finally rescheduled for day 28, by new Recruiting Coordinator (RC2).Day 28 — Phone interview, take two. Interviewer (a Software Engineer) asks me a little about myself, then moves on to the questions (I won't go into details, due to the NDA). About twenty minutes of basic Q&A about my language of choice (nothing remotely advanced). Then he asks me to describe (just out loud) the 'find' method of a common data structure. Then he modifies the problem definition slightly, and asks me how I would change the 'find' method. This seems fairly straightforward to me. He asks me to implement it in Java in a shared Google Doc. I do. I step through it with some examples. That's about it. I hang up: I think I nailed it.Day 36 — I email RC2 to check for any feedback. She defers to R1, who within minutes invites me on site to interview. I send my availabilities. I receive confirmation of my interview from RC2. I confirm, and send back two filled out forms (application + NDA; travel form).Day 37 — I make my travel arrangements through their travel agency. They pay for my flight, lodging for the night before and night after, rental car for the duration, transportation to the airport, and food for the duration. (I easily add two more days at my own expense.)Day 37 — R1 emails me to tell me he's leaving Google. R1 introduces R2 (not an engineer, this one).Day 38 — R2 emails introductions and asks when we can talk by phone.Day 42 — Introductory email from RC3, with two documents which are, again, verbatim excerpts of Steve Yegge's famous blog article.Day 43 — Phone call with R2, describes the on-site interview; nothing I didn't already know, except (fairly useless) one-line bios of my four interviewers. Eventually I start wondering why I'm seeing and hearing ""Google/YouTube"" when it used to be ""Google,"" so I ask. I find out I'm apparently applying for YouTube now and no one bothered to tell me. R2 also tells me she won't be able to make it to greet me on the day of my interviews, so R3 (also not an engineer) will be replacing her.Day 54 — On-site interviews. I show up to the wrong lobby, having assumed there was only one. (Pro-tip: check your email from the Recruiting Coordinator for the exact building and address.) Luckily, I was early enough to make it to the right building on time. Interview, interview, lunch, interview, interview. No breaks at all between interviews. Interviewers either give you a blank expression with no feedback as you talk or else hold your hand all the way to the solution. No middle ground. Half the interviewers didn't seem to want to be there. Thought I did kind of okayish in three, badly in one. Very hard to tell over all, but I was pretty sure I wasn't getting an offer.Day 57 — Within three minutes of each other, emails from both R2 and R3, asking to talk over the phone. I sort out the disorganization, get a call from R3, and am informed I will not be moving on. The only feedback I can get is that my ""coding"" is lacking, which doesn't make much sense to me.Day 58 — On to other companies.(Day 73 — Still no reimbursement of expenses...)",(Signed NDA)   Answer Question

Unfortunately, no one actually called me as scheduled for my interview, so I contacted my recruiter and she rescheduled.

I talked with the recruiter very briefly over the phone. He described the role and asked me if it was something I would be interested in, seemed like a very heavy software coding role. I said it was, and then he asked for me to send an updated resume and he would setup the phone interview.Phone interview was setup for a week away.Interviewer called on a very poor phone line, and was probably on speaker phone. Luckily we moved to the google doc that was setup for the interview and when I could not understand the interviewer he would type the info on the doc.The interview was pretty straight forward.The interviewer asked three questions, two dealing with arrays, and one dealing with a linked list. I struggled a bit through the first question. I worked through it, and the recruiter asked the typical solution time complexity questions, and how can you make it faster, etc.Question 2 I struggled for about 5 minutes to come up with a solution. I was explaining to the interviewer my thought process as I was trying to come up with a way to solve the problem, but that just confused him and he asked if I would just code it, but I wasn't coding it because I had no ideas yet on how to solve the problem. :) After about another minute I came up with a solution. I started coding it and once the interviewer saw that once I had come up with a solution and was able to code it without a hitch he asked me to move onto another question. This was the linked list question, and I knew a solution right away and coded it without any issues.Somewhere in there he asked me ""Do you have experience designing backend databases?"" This is more of a question I would expect for a DBA role, not a typical Software engineer interview question. Anyway I answered him, and that was pretty much the end of the interview. He asked me if I had any questions and I did, and he gave a good answer back...This was my second interview with Google.

I was given a long checklist of things to review and told I would be given a phone interview in about 10 days. I prepared quite a bit, but there's only so much you can do. You have to be a little lucky with who you get and hope you both find the same topics important.That said, I've been told the interview process at Google is a bit silly and I have to agree. It did not feel very kind, at least. My interviewer started with ""Hi I'm an Engineer at Google and you have an interview schedule for this time. Is this still a good time? Okay good. Let's start with the following question: "". Very little small talk, straight into a coding question. Okay, no prob. Except I could hear him typing away on his keyboard the whole time. There was basically zero commentary while I was coding, and nothing to say about my ""thinking out loud"".I completed the question, perhaps it took a bit longer than it should have, but it's an interview....nerves are gonna play a part. Anyway, I was definitely being scored on a timer. There is little doubt about that in my mind. If I wasn't given a timed score, then I lost points for there not being enough time to get around to other questions.He did go through it line by line, and I fixed all the little mistakes (which of course never would have happened in an IDE) and wound up with some decent code. It wasn't the best thing in the world, but it was fast and it worked.After the weekend I was told they would be going with some more experienced candidates. So again, little doubt in my mind that my score was somehow lessened due to the amount of time I took on the problem. I didn't sit and do nothing, I just wrote out code, then replaced it with something cleaner or better. Moved some sloppy stuff into a new function, etc."," Google asks that we do not share their questions, so I won't share the entire thing.

Google,"May 20, 2014",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 3+ months. I interviewed at Google (New York, NY) in April 2014.","One in person interviewer openly told me that he hates his job and that he would not recommend anyone work at Google...when he first walked into the room! He didn't even say hello, it was just the first thing he said! Overall after speaking with 6+ people only 2 introduced themselves or told me what teams they work on.My phone interviewer called 1.5 hours early and apologized for being 30 minutes late. He told me either get to a computer or the interview is off. He never introduced himself, he hung up during the call for 10 minutes while I coded and called back after I was done. He looked at my answer, asked a few questions for 10 minutes, and then just hung up without a goodbye- I never even got his name! Apparently he was happy with my answer though because I got a call back from a recruiter only 20 minutes later.My onsite timing was very poor. My first interviewer went on for over 1.5 hours The next interviewer was upset that he had to wait outside for over 45 minutes and not only didn't introduce himself, but was also happy to take his frustration out during the interview. He took his interview over in time, leaving me only 15 minutes until the cafeterias closed for lunch. Therefore we went to a smaller cafeteria which had nothing to drink but water. This would have been fine except after rushing through a meal and desperately needing caffeine (and bathroom) I was not in great shape for the next interview. The first 15 minutes were fine as I wrote 6 different tree algorithms for pre, post, and in order traversals in both iterative and recursive forms. The interviewer then asked me if I likes sudoku to which I replied that I didn't actually know the rules of how it worked. At that point he immediately ended the interview saying he wouldn't have time to explain it before asking his interview question. I was surprised that he didn't want to explain his interview question, but more surprised that he didn't have a backup question either. Since we were over an hour over schedule anyway the next person was already at the door and this is likely why he ended after only 15 minutes. I never got his name, team, or had an opportunity to ask a single question- which was also true for the next interviewer. He asked me a classical question that is common in universities. I already knew some of the possible answers and was upfront with him about this. He responded by taking the white board markers and saying he would like to discuss possible answers instead of coding them. After an hour of good discussion we had not written any code at all and he ended his interview. I assume that for the committee this probably did not reflect well since they like to see code. My system design question was interesting and went on for over 3 hours. The interviewer asked me ""As a team lead- what do you do when an [expletive] pm is trying to make your team death march, saying he will just replace employees as they burn out."" Having been through similar situations at Microsoft I was very good about handling this sort of thing in a way that is beneficial for all parties involved. I have to say that I was (and am still) surprised by the question though! By the end of my last interview the recruiter had left so I didn't say good bye to anyone.

I apparently did well as the recruiter contacted me about 2 hours after the interview to say I passed. I was forwarded off to a recruiter in Mountain View that set up an on-site interview for about 1.5 months later. I'm sure the time frames here could have been quicker, but for each step I wanted time to study.During the on-site interview, I met with 5 different engineers (4 where feedback was taken and 1 lunch interview). Each interview lasted between 45 minutes and 1 hour. I interviewed with members from 2 specific teams, the potential ones I would be joining if offered a position. Despite the fact the lunch interview was not supposed to count, I was told that the lunch interviewer was instrumental in getting me hired.It took quite a long time after the on-site interview until I received an offer. It took 2 weeks to collect interview feedback and 1 week to get the go-ahead to put me through the hiring committee. It took 2 weeks to go through the hiring committee and an additional week to go through the executive committee. At that point I had an offer, but it took another day or two to negotiate the details.

As other people also say, they don't give me any feedback, but the recruiter mentioned it was ""close"", though I don't know if she actually had detailed information about my interview.What's frustrating and made me feel negative about the process is that they do not give me any feedback. I don't even know if it was because of my performance at the interview or because of my past experience (I'm not a software engineer right now and coding is not my main job responsibility). I explicitly asked this point to the recruiter but she didn't clarify. I'm suspecting it's the latter and if that's the case, this whole process was totally a waste of time, but I never know.Another reason for my negative feeling is that the recruiter left a message on my home phone saying that she needs to follow-up about the interview. The fact I was taking an interview was secret to my family and I've repeatedly asked the recruiter not to call my home phone, but she didn't care about that. This has brought a situation in my family, even bigger than the fact that I was rejected. Recruiters should be more careful about each candidate's privacy, though failed candidates may not be important to them."," I signed an NDA and cannot disclose questions.

Asking if I would be interested in Google. I have a long resume and somewhat specialized set of skills in embedded systems so I said ok I will give it a go, but that I am not quite sure how my skills would be useful at Google. They waived the phone screen and moved me directly to an onsite interview. They send you a list of things to go over to prepare for the interview that looks like something out of college computer science course. I was really busy at my current job so I had little time to go over it, but it was fun revisiting the basic algorithms and data structures.Onsite was 3x45 miutes 1on1 interviews, lunch and 2 more 45 mins sessions. All back to back, no breaks other than lunch.1st session: Interviewer introduced himself gave me time to introduce myself for the 1st 10 mins. Then asked 2 questions. 1st was arrays didnt require to writ code, 2nd was dynamic programming asked to wrote code. I did well on both so we had 10 more mins to spare where I asked him questions.2nd session: Introduction took a really long time, interviewer talked at great length about himself and his work. Asked me if I am interviewing for real or just there to get some interview experience, because apparently thats what he did initially himself. When we got to the question there was only about 15 mins left. Tree related question, that in my opinion wasn't really presented very well. Code was required. I started solving it but he was basically walking me through every step. Not sure if he just wanted to pass me or realized that he already spent too much time talking. Got the correct solution, but I felt like I was being lead to it.3rd session: Embedded systems engineer, asked me a lot about my actual resume. In the end asked me a pretty basic question embedded system specific, asked to write code. Was really easy for me, did really well. Probably the most enjoyable session.Lunch: The weirdest part of the day. Interviewer only got notified the night before, didnt look like wanted to be there. Didn't even know where the closest cafeteria was. Ended up walking for about 15 mins around the campus. Dropped the tray when getting food and spilled lunch over clothes, got really upset. Then suggested we sit outside because its quieter there. But the day was hot and it was really uncomfortable, I was glad to get back inside.4th session: Usual introductions. General distributed systems question. Went pretty well in my opinion, but then I am not a distributed systems specialist, so cant really judge.5th session: The worst one ofthe day. Usual introductions. 2 Questions. 1st question supposed to be a warmup, really simple bit manipulation, but for some reason my brain just went into a feeze, not sure if it was the stress or the sun from the lunch. Anyway I worked manually through some samples and did come up with an algorithm and a correct solution. In fact the interviewer corrected something in my solution, but when I started running it through a test case it turned out my initial code was in fact correct, so we reverted it. Because 1st question took so much time, we only had about 10 mins for the 2nd one which was supposed to be the main question. So we didn't really finish it.Recruiter called me a week later saying that they decided not to go forward with my candidacy at this time. I am not really too bothered since I am pretty happy at my current job and this was more of a learning experience, but I admit that if they did make me a good offer, I would've seriously considered it.While driving home I did come up with a really good solution to that unfinished question from the 5th session. And then also found every single question that I got asked in my interview on programming websites. So looks like if I wasn't so busy and just spent more time preparing, the interview would've gone much smoother. I thought just experience would be enough to pull me through.Other than the lunch person and the 2nd session interviewer, everybody else was very pleasant and enjoyable to talk to."," All were unexpected.

I went over Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle, its a good book to review basic concepts. No questions I got actually came out of the book, but its good mental prep for the kind of problems you'll face.Also try top coder to work on coding if you are out of date writing actual code. I feel top coder questions are a bit brute force compared to the questions you'll get. Top coder questions ask you to accomplish a task, but the extent of what you'll end up using is arrays and strings. You won't get good coverage of things like trees, linked lists, etcs.Don't assume you'll need to get everything right during interviews. I didn't for sure and one interviewer had a distinctly negative attitude (whether this was intended or he actually flunked me I don't know), but I still ended up doing well enough to pass. Also, don't worry about the interviewers typing or writing during the interview. Apparently, they need to take all of your code verbatim to give to the hiring committee, so however much you write, they need to write. Stay calm and talk through your answers. Don't assume you did poorly or well, its too hard to guess and treat each interviewer individually.Overall a long process, but a fair one. In engineering its important to keep standards high and consistent."," Bunch of technical questions, some problem solving but basic, some knowledge related, some system design.

The entire process has taken 2 months and the worst thing – communication with my recruiter was almost completely broken: I did not receive responses for several days; the recruiter scheduled phone calls and did not show up, etc. From the very beginning I had the impression that the recruiter is not very interested in dealing with me. I was treated as a low priority candidate. May be it's because of the lack of internal referrals.I think, I could be a very good match for Google: PhD with strong math background, excellent GPA, 15+ years of continuous coding experience, patents, lots of cool research projects I worked on in the past including projects related to the position I was applying for, Google's culture fit, strong desire to be a part of Google. I did very well during the phone interview and was invited for the onsite part.I think onsite interviews (4) went very well too. What really surprised me is that interviewers asked lots of questions about my experience.Problem solving part was not very challenging. This was a little bit disappointing. Tasks were routine and not very well though-out. Solving a difficult problem you have a chance to shine. When you are dealing with an easy problem it's all just about how fast and accurate you are in white-boarding. I cannot say I was absolutely perfect, but I am sure I did not fail any single part, although sometimes I experienced problem understanding what the interviewer really wanted to see.Interviewers were nice and friendly. I did not have the feeling I was dealing with stars. Several times interviewers were even not up to speed with my ideas and my concern is they might not be able to record everything accurately.I was waiting for the feedback for 3 weeks. By this time I already had an offer from a big Google's competitor, but I was patiently waiting for the ""job of my dream"". I don't know what really happened during these 3 weeks. According to the recruiter, she was collecting interviewer's responses. It strange, since it sounds like my case has not even reached the hiring committee. After 3 weeks the recruiter scheduled a call where she told me they would not move forward with my candidature, because ""I did not walk through problems well enough"".I do not agree with this conclusion, since I got the opposite impression from my interview. My guess – the reason for the rejection was something else. After all I am extremely disappointed.My recommendation to other candidates: think twice before applying for a position at Google. It takes too long and the result is very unpredictable. They are not just looking for smart/skilled/passionate. Evidently there are some hidden criteria. And don't trust Google's articles and videos about their recruiting process too much. They present their understanding of the perfect recruiting process. The reality is very different.The other advise is try not to spend too much time describing your experience and asking questions. You have only 45 minutes and you will need this time to work on algorithmic problems. I typically had no more than 25-30 minutes left for problem solving and I was usually given 2 tasks. Note that coming up with a right idea and implementing the main functionality is not considered a complete solution. For the record they want to see 100% completed code. If you've run out of time just because the task selected by the interviewer was too large for the timeframe, it's your problem. Interviewer is always right. The phrase ""did not walk through problems well enough"" in my case could easily mean ""proposed the right solution for the second problem, but did not finish writing the code in time"".",No difficult questions at all. There were some problems that just required a lot of time to carefully walk through.   1 Answer

Google,"Mar 19, 2014",No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,I applied online. The process took 3+ months. I interviewed at Google in February 2014.,"I had applied through their job portal online. I was contacted by the first recruiter in January 3rd week. We exchanged emails, she had me fill out a couple of forms, and then I was handed over to another recruiter. She, in turn, handed me over to yet another recruiter.The recruiter coordination was not good, their responses were all over the place. Two recruiters were working in tandem to schedule my phone interview and they managed to convert the interview time from PST to my local time with an 1hr error. This ended up with me waiting for the phone screen call one hour earlier than it actually was. I had given up and decided that the person would not call and then I receive a call 1 hour later.The interview itself was appallingly conducted. First of all, the interviewer seemed to be in a room with a lot of echo. Second, he must have been using some kind of phone system on speaker or something similar because I could hear my own voice echoed back. I mentioned this to him twice, since it made it difficult to hear his words with the reverberation in the room blurring his voice and my voice echoing.The first time, he said I must be using a headset and that the microphone was too far away from the mouth. I told him that I wasn't using a headset. He waved it away.The second time, he said the same thing. By then I had given up on the interview. I couldn't hear much, he wasn't helping. Trying to decipher the conversation and trying to code simultaneously had become a horrible adventure. Besides, he wasn't listening to half of what I'd said, be it trying to explain my problem-solving method or be it my concern regarding the fact I couldn't hear much over the garble.Some of the start-off questions (break-ice questions) he had asked regarding my resume were pointedly patronizing or so I felt. I understand however that a phone screen doesn't give you enough indicators about these things and I could be wrong.The questions themselves were basic programming, then some threading, concurrency, map-reduce trivia questions.I understand many people have the ambition or life-goal to work for the company. Perhaps to them this process might be forgivable. Most interviews probably aren't like this and I might have had something of an exception. I consider it disrespectful of my time and an unwillingness to listen to what I could potentially provide."," nothing too difficult, many trivia questions   Answer Question"

He emailed me out of the blue, and said he really liked my github profile.Honestly, at first, I didn't believe it was real. We emailed back and forth a few times, but I wasn't really looking to moving to the Bay Area, so I never actually sent in my CV.About a month goes by, and he emails me back. He just wanted to follow up. Said that he never received the resume, and hoped I would get back in touch. So I told him about my situation, and he mentioned that they had an LA office. This was news to me, and much closer to home. So I sent in my resume, and he connected me to a recruiter who was closer to me.All in all, I talked with about 4 different people in recruiting. All of them were incredibly nice and helpful. My first ""interview"" was with the second recruiter. It was really just getting to know me, what my interests were, and trying to get a feel for my fit with the company.After that interview, we scheduled a technical phone interview. Gave me to weeks to study up. Lots of review material was sent my way, which was awesome. Ended up reading my algorithms text book again, it was quite a nice read, but I don't believe I would have done poorly on the phone interview, even had I not read it. The tips/references they sent to me were extremely helpful. They sent me Titles/Authors of some amazing books, I recommend reading them even if you aren't interviewing with Google.After passing the phone interview, we had an on-site scheduled about a week later. This was much harder than the phone interview. I get the idea that the phone was just to weed out the weaker candidates. The on-site consisted of 5 one-on-one interviews, plus one lunch ""interview"" where I was able to ask all of my questions. All of them were about 45 minutes each.Every interviewer I talked to was very interesting, and we always had something in common to talk about. The questions were all very interesting problems. There was one point in one of the questions where one of the interviewers put a star next to a line I wrote to remind him to go back and follow up on a comment I made that sounded interesting. I enjoyed the interviews, because it felt like I was back in college, talking to my peers about fascinating problems.There were one or two interviews that I feel I didn't do so hot on.

I interviewed at Google (Mountain View, CA) in January 2014.","I was first contacted by Google in 2012 a couple months after I took up current employment. This recruiter was energetic, interesting and seemed genuinely interested in finding the right spot for me at Google. Unfortunately, I had just started my new job and have a personal policy of staying at a place of work for at least a year. That, and the project was interesting and exciting so I did not follow up and let him know why.Time passed and eventually he moved on from Google. About a year later another recruiter contacted me. She seemed nice but nowhere near as enthusiastic. We setup a time to talk over a Hangout but unfortunately she cancelled at the last minute. Not good, I'd changed my plans around to fit. So I agreed to her request to setup a new Hangout the next week. Nothing happened. After about two weeks (I waited due to work commitments) I got back in contact with her and we worked out a new time and the interview went ahead. She was courteous and seemed reasonably enthusiastic, but nothing like the previous guy who had a specific position in mind. No, this was now very open ended, non-specific and I started to feel like just another candidate. Despite this I decided to see where it went.So a technical phone interview was setup and it was possible one of the worst phone interviews of my career. I could not hear a thing. The call quality was terrible. This made it extremely hard to hear what I was even supposed to be doing. Fortunately, the Googler on the other end was very helpful, polite and understanding. We eventually nutted out what he wanted me to do via Google Docs.Then I waited over two weeks for feedback. I passed the interview but then I was transferred unceremoniously to recruiter the 3rd. This guy was even less enthusiastic but communication was clear and to the point. He ignored my request to talk to him over Hangout. But, the second interview got organised with a team I was interested in.The second interview however was far worse than the first. Call quality was better but still not great. Worse still however was the interviewer who, seemingly, had zero interest in being there. He explained what he was looking for, a basic problem, and for the rest of the interview ignored most of my questions. I was trying to talk through the problem, explain what I was doing and also try and see how he would work with me. From what I heard I'd expected this from a Google interview. And indeed, the last interviewer was great. However, this guy did not answer my questions - aside from some grunts - and seemed more worried that I wasn't using STL. I told him I just wanted to keep it simple as it was a simple question.Did I forget to mention that he was a full 15 minutes late to the interview? I cannot stand this and it is disrespectful and very tardy. Also, the question asked had nothing to do with the specific position I was interviewing for.In the end, I've no doubt I gave a sub-optimal impression on my second interview. But what do you expect from a sub-optimal interview? Garbage in, garbage out. So in the end I did not get an offer.While I understand that I am perhaps in the minority here as far as Google interviews go I can see from the stats that I am certainly not alone.

Google,"Feb 15, 2014",No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"I applied online. I interviewed at Google (Mountain View, CA).","Applied for Google Software Engineer position online. Recruiter contacted me within a week to set-up a phone interview. The phone screen was scheduled within week. The interviewer asked about various data structures and general computer science concepts. Asked me several questions about queues, and heaps. After that two programming questions: 1) traverse array in a spiral order. 2) check if directed graph contains a cycle. in 2 weeks I was contacted to set up on-site interview. I asked to schedule interview 3 weeks later, so I could prepare for it.There were 4 technical interviews onsite, one lunch interview (just informal talk with some guy from Google glass department), and lastly PhD dissertation discussion.First question was in-order traversal of BST. I wrote the code. Then asked me two check if two different BSTs have same inorder traversal. I suggested to store first inorder traversal into vector, and while traversing second BST check if the element values match. I also started suggesting using linked list, or modified recursive approach, but he said to make life easy and go with the simple solution.Second interviewer gave me array, with elements first strictly increasing, then strictly decreasing. Asked me to find the largest number. I suggested to use binary search. O(logN) time complexity, with no additional space required. After implementing the code he asked another question. Given infinite doubly linked list, and separate list of elements, which are linked to some linked list elements. Find out from the list of elements how many neighboring groups are formed. I suggested to use Hashtable, to make look-up process quick, and traverse the elements and check if they are neighboring elements. O(N) time and space complexity. Implemented the code, and time ran out to test if with different cases.Third interview was the weirdest. The guy had thick accent and from the beginning became apparent communication was an issue. He gave me system design question: Observer class has three methods AddObserver(), RemoveObserver(), NotifyAllObservers(). After asking some clarification questions, I suggested to use doubly linked list to keep track of all observers, and hash table to look-up the individual observer. Then he asked to implement three methods. After implementing the code in JAVA he told me the program would not work. Apparently the Observer was designed for Chrome browser. He went into details when user clicks on mouse and then key-press is released. I responded the initial question was very vague and asked for more clarification and precise requirements. I suggested what I would change to go around the problem, but time ran out and didn't get a chance to modify the code on whiteboard.After that I had lunch and came back for fourth technical interview.Fourth interview: the guy told me to add two numbers in base 3 system. The input: two base 3 streams provided as String. function should return sum of the two numbers also in String format as base 3 stream. I suggested to convert from base 3 into base 10, add numbers and convert back to base 3. I know how to add two (base 2) binary streams without conversion, since I was under the time pressure I went easy way. I implemented conversion from base 3 to base 10. The interviewer said he was satisfied and wanted me to solve another problem. He gave me file size, and asked me to partition file into chunks, so that each chunk size is power of two, and the number of chunks is minimal. I suggested to find the nearest power of two and obtain absolute value of difference between the original file size, and nearest power of two. Then re-apply the process until reminder is power of two (1 is 2^0). There was time pressure, so didn't have time for analysis, just implemented and turned in the code.Last interview was PhD dissertation discussion. It went alright. Most interviews went ok, except the 3rd one, during which I had hard time communicating. Within a week recruiter emailed me saying hiring committee didn't want to move forward with hiring."," I didn't feel any of the questions were difficult, I haven't been stuck at any point, but apparently that wasn't enough.

Google,"Dec 30, 2013",Declined Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied through an employee referral. The process took 6+ weeks. I interviewed at Google (New York, NY).","I applied through a friend at Google. I had a 45 min phone interview with a software engineer. He asked for a brief overview of my research and then asked several coding questions. They were average difficulty, similar to the ones on CareerCup or glassdoor.Then, I had an on-site interview, which consisted of 4 coding interviews and 1 research interview. The 4 coding interviews went over algorithms and system design. The interviews had a shared document that let them know which topics had already been covered, so it pays to prepare for all of the topics covered in a typical software interview. The research interview was a casual conversation about my thesis research.

When they see you are solving questions with ease, they turn it up a notch. I found a very heavy emphasis on graph algorithms in my questions. I was expecting it but not to this level, so better prep for those! esp. graph search algorithms and their variations. Lots of code writing on the whiteboard to the point where you run out of space! Had to design a data structure with certain properties and the interviewer kept asking for new methods. One of the interviewers had a thick accent and it was very hard to understand him.

First he inquired if I was interested to which I said yes. We briefly discussed a phone chat but quickly moved forward with an on site interview.

So I agreed to a face-to-face interview at their headquarters.At this point, I was introduced to a second recruiter who helped set up my travel arrangements, discussed what to expect, and answered any additional questions I had. She had also given me a list of topics to study and a couple of websites to visit to help prep. She was the one I met with when I went onsite and she let me get a drink and use the bathroom before heading to a conference room where I would spend the next few hours. She then left me after giving me a chance to ask any more last minute questions.I had a schedule of 3 interviewers followed by a lunch break followed by 2 more interviewers to finish the day. The interviewers were nice and accommodating and happy to answer any questions but were very mindful of the time except for my final interviewer who probably spent 2 hours with me. They gave the impression they are passionate about what they're doing and did not dismiss anything I said as foolish or dumb (I mention this as I've read other interview accounts who said their interviewers were snobbish and elitist).After about a week, I emailed my recruiter asking about a status. She said they were still waiting on the feedback from some of the engineers and that she would find out where they were with this.

Second phone interview did not happen: interviewer got sick and did not warn the recruiter. After struggling to reschedule for about a week they decided to skip that phase and do an on-site interview.Onsite interview consisted of five rounds 45 minutes each. Most of the interviewers gave one large problem and kept me polishing the solution until the time ran out. I did not really get a chance to ask a lot of questions about the company (just asked two and answers did not really amuse me).I don't remember the most difficult problem, but two largest ones were: write `Game Of Life' (not in pseudocode, in Java!) and write a procedure that draws a line in a bitmapped array (again, in a real programming language). That had to be done on a whiteboard (side note: while I has writing interviewers were copying my solutions into their notebooks by hand). All problems throughout my interview included questions about complexity and some included questions about optimization and testing.I got a feeling that the work is challenging from technical point of view, but the interview process seems quite ridiculous (especially writing substantially large programs on the board) and most interviewers' attitude can be described as `quite arrogant.'

I interviewed at Google (Chicago, IL) in January 2014.","Applied through LinkedIn in early October, total process took about 4 months. The recruiter contacted me 4-5 weeks after my initial application. We set up a phone interview, but the earliest available date was mid-December. Phone interview was brief and pretty simple (basic data structures / algorithms stuff), and I was asked for an onsite interview just a couple hours after completing this. The onsite interview had to wait until January, however, due to the holiday schedule. Arrived at the Google office on the morning of the interview and was met (about 10 minutes late) by what turned out to be my first interviewer (an engineer, who didn't seem to know his way around the office). After 45 minutes, the interview ends abruptly and new person walks in. This is the basic pattern for the whole day (it's a 6 hour process, including lunch in the commissary): for the most part, each interview was pretty casual and the difficulty level was not nearly what I expected -- nearly all the questions were object-oriented design and basic algorithms (not even any graph theory, which I was anticipating).I felt pretty good about my performance overall, although I probably spent more time with certain problems than I should have -- it was difficult to get a sense of proper pacing since each interviewer had a vastly different demeanor and the range of problems varied from simple recall to complex problem solving. About 2 weeks after my interview, I received a call from the recruiter who simply said that I had not been selected at this time. She was polite and apologetic, but could offer no actionable feedback.Overall, my interactions with Google employees were friendly and relatively prompt. I felt the process took far too long, but I guess this is to be expected for such a large company.

There almost no discussion of work history or anything other than technical questions. Most of the time was spent at the whiteboard working on and then refining the answer to a question. They mainly focused on data structures and algorithms around them. Things like BST, hash tables, tree traversals. The questions were not standard algorithm questions that you tend to see around, but a bit more involved. They were interested in your speaking about the algorithmic complexity of your solution and how to choose appropriate data structures. Hash vs. BST came up a bit. The coding that had to be done was a bit awkward for a whiteboard. The solutions were not necessarily short. One interview revolved around a higher level system design question that was refined throughout the discussion. There was very little to no time to ask questions or discuss working at google and the inteviewers did not seem interested in selling me on google. The lunch conversation was not an interview and did not contribute towards the assessment. The person I ate with was very nice and seemed honest about the way things are at google.Over 2 weeks after the interview I was contacted with the rejection.Overall the process was smooth and people were helpful and nice. Though I did not find anyone to be particularly interested in selling the company. The interviewers were hard but fair for the most part. One interviewer did not describe the problem particularly well and had me coding a solution to the wrong problem for a while."," General algorithm questions. particularly focused on algorithmic complexity.

Google,"May 17, 2010",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 2+ months. I interviewed at Google (Mountain View, CA) in April 2010.","I was contacted directly by a recruiter, we exchanged a few emails and talked for a few minutes about past experience, skills, interests, etc. After I agreed to continue with the process, I had a phone interview, an on-site interview, was told that they'll contact my references and then received the offer. 1-3 weeks passed between each step. The recruiter talked me through the process and kept me informed about the progress of my application, but the process itself is rather opaque: you do not get to know exactly what you could be working on, you're unlikely to meet people you will be working with, and you do not get much feedback until the offer / no offer. Hiring decisions are made by committee(s) (i.e. not by a hiring manager who has an opening in his team), and although the recruiters may have a good feeling of which direction the application is going, they cannot promise anything until the decision is made.The phone interview was with one software engineer for 45-60 mins. After a few ice-breaking questions, they jumped into a few technical questions and then gave me a few minutes for my questions. The on-site interview consisted of 5 1-1 technical interviews of 45 minutes each with software engineers, plus a lunch break in one of the cafeterias with another engineer; In total I probably answered 20-30 different questions on data structures, algorithms, and discrete maths. You write down the answers on a whiteboard or notebook and the interviewers take notes. Sometimes correct syntax is required, sometimes pseudocode is acceptable. The level of the questions varied a lot and covered a lot of areas: one minute I am manipulating the bits of a byte to implement one coding trick, the next I am discussing heuristics for an intractable problem. Most interviewers gave me a few minutes at the end to ask them questions, and the discussions touched briefly on my past experience although I was not expected (and one really shouldn't) give too much information on my current work; keep in mind that the interviewee signs an NDA but the interviewers don't.In my current job I do a fair amount of interviewing and I often interview candidates who give the impression of being competent but fall short of doing well in the technical interview because they're unprepared. This often leads to a no-hire decision, probably an unfortunate false negative, but hiring decisions are very hard to make since bad recruits are a severe liability to an engineering team. I did not want to be such a candidate so I prepared as best as I could; luckily the process was slow enough to give me some time to do that. I read (and worked through the exercises of) textbooks on algorithms, datastructures, discrete maths, the languages I use, practiced my handwriting, brushed up on standard CS topics I do not currently use, and learned a bit about Google specific technology like MapReduce. I also brushed up on my past research/experience and areas related to that. I was not asked on most of what I prepared on, and I was asked on areas I did not think of preparing on, but I think that this preparation really helped me to be in the right mindset to solve the type of questions I was asked. In my opinion, good knowledge in the fundamentals is essential but the most important skill is problem solving. I was asked questions about areas I'm not familiar with, but (with some help from the interviewers) I was able to break them down into smaller components I could at least tackle. I probably didn't impress in those questions but it was better than throwing in the towel. I was not asked directly on specific datastructures and algorithms, but if I decided to use some to solve a problem, then I was asked detailed questions about them. So: problem solving is the skill, CS knowledge provides the tools.I have negligible experience of being an interviewee, and it's amazing all the silly mistakes my nerves made me do; I really felt that I had misrepresented myself as being clumsy (at least more than I am...), but luckily it is a myth that one mistake is enough to fail the whole process. I did not feel the arrogance in the interviewers mentioned in other reviews here. Not all of them made me feel comfortable, but overall they're what you expect from a silicon valley company. Before the application proceeded, I couldn't tell how I did, but I felt that it was a fair process, and definitely a positive experience that left me with a very good impression of Google; If you are good at the fundamentals, be able to show a level of expertise on everything you list in your resume, have spent the time to prepare, and you're not intimidated by relentless questioning, possibly on areas you're not that familiar with, then you have a good chance of satisfying enough interviewers to move on to the next step. Keep in mind that Google affords to be picky so their hiring process tries to minimize hiring bad recruits at the cost of rejecting potentially good ones.",I got the impression that interviewers are selected depending on what's on your resume.

My experience is in NLP, and I specifically applied to Google for a job doing NLP, either in machine translation, speech recognition, or one of the other many NLP tasks they do.

I interviewed at Google (Mountain View, CA) in March 2010.","The interesting parts of the Google interview process are all under NDA and you can't discuss them for two years after the interview. Here's what I can tell you:- Their initial contact with me was via email, through LinkedIn. I didn't contact them.- Two rounds of telephone interviews are required for out-of-state candidates (i.e. anybody they will have to pay to fly in). Both interviews will have a ""take home assignment"" portion - a piece of code that you'll have to write and email to your interviewer within a fixed time (1 hour for me). If you pass these hurdles you'll be brought out to Mountain View for an all-day in-person interview.- Travel arrangements are absolutely painless, it's all handled for you and all you need to do is write an email and pick dates.- Google flies you in on day X, interview day X+1, fly out day X+2; no redeyes necessary. They pay for flight, hotel, rental car, and per diem for meals. You get to pick airlines and rental companies for frequent flyer miles. Note that you have to put your meals and the rental car on your own credit card, and file for reimbursement. They say to allow several weeks for reimbursement, but my experience was that the money arrived by direct deposit in about a week after filing. If you wish to stay extra days to explore the neighborhood and pay for the additional rental car and hotel expenses yourself, that's fine.The interviews are extremely technical and involve real programming exercises, manipulating data structures, analyzing or describing algorithms, etc. Be prepared to iterate what you're doing on the board. Be ULTRA prepared with knowledge of standard search and sort algorithms and junior-level CS data structures; also be aware of their big-O complexity. While the interview questions aren't exactly complicated, they cover so much territory that there is no way to study for them from ""cold"". If you are not programming on a daily basis in the languages in which you're being interviewed, you will not pass these tests.The process moves extremely quickly - at most a day or two between steps.

Originally contacted by someone in Mtn View and then transferred to someone in Santa Monica.Phone interview was intense, but I did my best. I felt like I got most of the questions wrong. My interviewer walked me through any incorrect answers and overall it was a pleasant experience. The interviewer was very good. Most of my questions were about searching and sorting, about half of them were the stupid questions from their database. He asked a good 10-15 questions during our phone call but most were short. Unlike most people, for some reason I was not asked any coding questions.The on-site interview was a disaster.1. It started with a discussion of my thesis topic which was fine. Expect them to understand your topic no matter how esoteric or specific it is.2. A second interviewer asked about my thesis. He did not like my topic at all claiming that it doesn't scale well. Well, excuse me for not having access to Google's data! Then proceeded to ask some dumb questions (specific to Java) from their database. Finally, I started coding on the board. If I did something wrong, he was very misleading in the ""hints"" that he was trying to give; he could not articulate what the problem was with my code.3. I had lunch with my phone interviewer.

I know Java, C and C++ but they are not my everyday languages. To my dismay, most of the questions were phrased ""Used Java"" or ""Use C, C++ or Java"" or ""use C or C++"".

Google,"Nov 7, 2010",Declined Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied through other source. The process took 6+ weeks. I interviewed at Google (Mountain View, CA) in October 2010.","I greatly anticipated this interview. Many engineers, including me, wants an opportunity to work with the best and the brightest. But the interview went wrong in many ways, and it changed my mind about wanting to work at Google. The on site interview was 3 sessions 45 minutes each.1) The recruiter was incredibly slow. It took almost three weeks for the on site to be scheduled. He often promised to get back to me tomorrow, then I don't hear from him for 5 days. It was frustrating working with him. But I kind of expected this since my friends who interviewed before had similar experience.2) The first interviewer had a strong accent. I couldn't understand him so I had to ask him to repeat many times. I felt like I was being rude, but thinking back, his inability to explain the questions was cutting into my time to answer them. Then he asked me to review some C++ code. Wait a minute, I am a Java programmer and the recruiter said the interview will be conducted in Java. The last time I used C++ was 7 years ago. I explained it to him, but he insisted, I gave it my best shot while struggling with syntax.3) The second interviewer was arrogant and rude! He seemed like he didn't want to be there. Again, asked me to code a problem that is only relevant in C++. I gave it the best answer in Java. He argued with me that it will not work, then I had to explain to him null assignment in Java also deallocates a variable because of GC. He wouldn't admit he was wrong, so he made a degrading comment about how Java programmer knows nothing about memory management. Then he asks a harder question basically requires putting everything in a hashmap then check for a match. He rudely interrupts me while I tried to explain my thoughts. At one point, I literally got a little angry. I happen to be a pretty patient and none confrontational person. I think he had a canned answer in mind, and he didn't want to listen to anything else.4) The third interviewer was 7 minutes late, but he was nicer. He seemed cocky about working at google. Many things he said started with something like ""at google, this is how we do..."". The questions he asked was a little confusing.

I interviewed at Google (Mountain View, CA) in January 2011.","January 2011, Mt.View campusVisited Google first 5 years ago, that time was rejected. This time contacted by recruiter again, offered to come for the interview again.Sweeping Silicon Valley rumor mill brought several facts about interview practices – each interviewer has to submit rather detailed report to the hiring committee recording after you everything written on the white board and allegedly even recording what you say. Sometime 2 interviewers are talking to the candidate, in such cases second person is a trainee. Sometimes there are two rounds if Google is uncertain. Candidate has to select programming language of preference for the interview (my choice was C as I was applying to what recruiter called “kernel” positions in ChromeOS team).Was first met by the recruiter, he spent 10 mins with me, I asked about the practices above, even though he confirmed, but downplayed ""exact recording of what candidate says part"". Answered that written report on a candidate is about 1-2 typed pages on average.Total met 6 people, 5 technical, one lunchFirst interviewer:1. General discussion on testing methodologies (why unit tests might fail?)2. Asked me to code review some C++ code even though I explicitly selected that my language of preference is C. Couldn't say much as I don't use C++.3. Asked to implement C++ method for a class ""arbitrary reader"" given we have a class 4K reader which can read only 4K blocks.Second interviewer:1. Given two binary search trees, write function which tells if two such trees are the same – (i.e. same info in the nodes, same branching to left and right at every node).Recursive implementation was presented. Was asked to do non-recursive version (question was not about better solution, say, w/constant memory) – I proposed to change recursive algorithm to non-recursive with a user-defined stack (formal transformation rather boring but doable, FORTRAN people do it). Demonstrated that but code was messy with gotos, etc. Asked about complexity – both recursive and non-recursive versions required linear stack in worst case of pathological one-sided trees.Third interviewer:1. Reverse bits in 32-bit integer.2. Given two large files with 64-bit integers produce file with integers which are present in both files and estimate O(?) complexity of your algorithm.Proposed solution of splitting both files in n chunks (k integers in each) and solving n^2 subproblems while incrementally updating the result by merging sorted files of partial results (we will need to sort each chunk once). After algorithm was finalized, we checked the complexity and it was something cubic by n and k. Too bad. Navigated me to the solution to sort both files and find intersection by merging, this was better. As an afterthought I still think that when files do not have large overlap my solution might be winning as sorting original large files is not required (k should be selected so that each chunk could be sorted in memory, how about n=k=sqrt(file-size)?:).3. One has a stream of queries coming over a day, how do you keep a cache of 1000 most-frequently used ones? Did not have time for this one.Fourth interviewer:1. Asked light technical questions on past items listed in resume.2. When you are doing ""read()"" call what it happening under the hood in user space? (answer needs to clarify how it is translated to a system call by libc).3. How to find a median in a large file of 64-bit integers.I mentioned first the classical ""order statistics"" algorithm with splitting initial group into 5-tuples and finding median of medians, etc. My proposal on the problem was toadopt median algorithm to the case when we are dealing with large file – however no additional disk space could be used, it should be done ""in place"" and it is not clear for me if order statistics algorithm could be done easily with such restriction. Interviewer downplayed the order statistics deal and navigated me to the solution that I liked – keep in memory counters for binary intervals practically counting occurences of prefixes (say, 24-bit prefixes). After that we are able to tell what prefix range the median belongs to, recalculate index of the element to search instead of median and go over the particular prefix range and find it there.

Google,"May 17, 2011",No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied online. The process took 1 day. I interviewed at Google (New York, NY) in May 2011.","I applied online for a job opening for Software Engineer at Google New York and was contacted straight away by a very friendly recruiter. We talked over the phone about the Google culture in general, the position and my experience. Also had to rate myself on a scale of 1 to 10 on my programming language of choice (Java). A date was set for a technical phone interview. I read up on my CS basics, my core programming language and some Google whitepapers.A software engineer contacted me at the exact agreed upon time. No small talk, straight to business. First question was about garbage collection in Java. Interviewer was looking for a very specific answer which I more or less could give. Next question was about memory leaks in Java and how to cause them. I wasn't aware of any way to do that, but apparently the substring method on a String object can cause it, first time I ever heard of it... Then he asked about pointer arithmetic. I gave him a generic description but he was looking for more detail. I explained that an array reserves a memory block where in principle one could use pointer arithmetic to get the next memory block reserved for an index in the array. By this time I got the sense that this was a C/C++ programmer proving the superiority of his language of choice over Java. Then he asked about the synchronized keyword's use on a method what guarantees it gives and how it behaves under different usecases, no problems there.Next came the programming task that I needed to resolve in a shared Google doc document. I had to implement encode / decode methods that would serialize/deserialize a binary tree. I didn't analyse the problem enough in advance and assumed he meant a balanced binary tree. After a while he gave me a hint that I was on the wrong track.

Google,"Apr 27, 2011",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"The process took a week. I interviewed at Google (Mountain View, CA) in April 2011.","The Google interview process typically includes a phone interview or two as well as an on-site, in a process that takes a couple of weeks to a month. I had a pending offer from another company, so they expedited my interview (skipped the phone), and expedited the hiring committee review. I got flight info for two days later, flew out, interviewed the next day (Friday), and had an offer by Monday.At the on-site interview, they put you up in a pretty nice hotel and provide a rental car. GPS is recommended, as the Mountain View / Sunnyvale suburbs can be difficult to navigate.The Google campus is simply spectacular. They have dozens of buildings, with bikes for transportation between bulidings, buses in and out of different neighborhoods, multiple dining cafes, multiple gyms, etc. Google is also located all over the country (and world) - you can actually pick your location if MV suburbia isn't your cup of tea. Projects/teams are distributed across separate offices.As for the actual interview:5 separate 45 minute interviews with other Software Engineers. The interviewers come from a wide background (infrastructure, front end, etc). Questions were all technical in nature, mostly coding oriented. They did ask pointed questions about previous experience, projects, general resume stuff, etc.The interview questions were well thought out and relatively innovative. The interviewers presented them clearly, and were very helpful in discussing solution possibilities. Some of the questions were pretty straightforward, but the trickier ones were excellent - we were able to devise solutions and optimize them multiple times, discussing what was better about different approaches.Everyone I talked to was very upbeat, intelligent, and nice. The last interviewer I had seemed a bit surly at first, but quickly warmed up and became very affable.The hiring process was very informative. The recruiters gave loads of information when asked, and were very up front about a lot of aspects of the company. The interviewers themselves were able to answer many questions about the gritty details of working at Google.The hiring itself is actually done by a separate group of people from the interviewers, and is decided somewhat up the chain of command."," Google asks interviewees to not share specific details on interview questions. They were coding-oriented questions. They required a varied set of algorithms and data structures to solve, especially including graphs, heaps, linked lists, and hash tables. Sorting algorithms were also emphasized. Some of the interview questions were quite unique, but could be abstracted in neat ways.Google does provide a significant amount of material before the interview(s) to help you study, including links to reading material and the types of questions you can expect.They were relatively difficult, but the interviewers were helpful.   1 Answer"

Google,"May 2, 2011",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 3+ months. I interviewed at Google (Mountain View, CA) in April 2011.","A google recruiter cold-called me on 3 Feb 2011 (I guess they got my résumé from an old co-worker?) and I was kinda bored so I aksed her to send me more info about the job. The recruiter sounded eerily stoked on both the company and the project (kept describing it all as ""exciting""). By the end of the next week we had scheduled a phone interview for 22 Feb. (I wasn't in any sorta hurry).Then I rescheduled the phone interview for a week later, 1 Mar. Shared google doc, the interviewer pasted some code and aksed me to find bugs in it and repair them. Some other question I don't remember. The topics were like race conditions in multi-threaded systems or something. It was nothing shocking, and the interviewer seemed to have a more muted stoke about working for google.Two days later, the ultra-stoked recruiter called back with a second recruiter to invite me for an in-person. The second recruiter sounded pretty hepped up on the brand-name too. I think the second was a more senior recruiter. We scheduled an interview for 2 weeks later, 17 Mar.They put me up in a hotel in Mtn View. The hotel was perfectly fancy, and had lots of nerd-themed items in the desk in the room (think weird Rubik's Cubes, puzzles made of heavy wire, &c). Next morning I woke up and drove to the googleplex. It was pretty, with ample parking, and a kinda agrestic setting. Flowers, vegetables, nerds. I waited in building 43 and watched people come in and out. it was easy to tell the difference between the home team and the visitors -- the googlers were the ones who looked super-jazzed, and the others looked uneasy.I mean, noticeably super-jazzed.The senior recruiter came `round and took me to the first interview room. I'd been scheduled for three interviews, but he told me they had found a fourth interviewer and would I mind staying longer for more probing. (I said I wouldn't mind.) The first interviewer came in, aksed a question about like statefulness in distributed systems or something, I wrote a big long answer on the board. he was mellow, genial, and helpful. The interview question wasn't too hard, and afterwards (when prompted) he expressed satisfaction with the company. He left, and another helpful, genial, and mellow engineer came in and aksed me some more basic cs stuff, and a question about how to build the back-end of a particular google product. She also expressed contentment with google as a place of employment.The guy who gave me the phone interview came and took me to lunch.We went to yet another building for my next interviews. A frankly-kinda-stressed-out-seeming engineer aksed questions about code prettification: namely, how to prettify the Java code I wrote on the white board. She took me to the next interview where a young guy aksed me a question about c-language bit-twiddling, and aksed a question about dynamic programming. my undergraduate cs courses were like 18 years previous, and I drew a blank. after futzing around w/ it for a bit, time was called and I drove home.I sorta figured that it would end there, so I wasn't suprised when they didn't call back. Two weeks later though, the senior recruiter called back to tell me they almost had all the interview reports, and that they just needed one guy's report before making a decision.Three days later, around 5 Apr, both recruiters started calling me and emailing me. I ignored them for a while, then finally phoned them back. They said they wanted me to talk with a few potential teams there to see if we could find a match.Over the next two weeks I spoke with six or seven folks, engineers and managers both. The tone of the calls went from testing my domain-awareness to openly soliciting my membership in their teams.Eventually (over the course of about a week) the recruiter reported the progress of my hiring order from hiring committee to I guess a second hiring committee to some kind of executive committee to the compensation manager to the executive approval, then they phoned me to tell me the nitty-gritty of the job offer.It was pretty good, so I accepted."," They made me promise not to tell.

Google,"Jun 6, 2011",No Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"The process took 5+ weeks. I interviewed at Google (Santa Monica, CA) in April 2011.","I was contacted by a recruiter from Google Southern California (Irvine and Santa Monica) through LinkedIn and was asked if I had any interest in applying to Google. I replied yes and then had a phone call with the recruiter (about 40 minutes) to talk about my background and experience, and the recruiter talked about the interview process and answered all my questions. The recruiter was amazingly nice and very easy to talk to. The first thing I had to do was choose an office to apply to. I chose Santa Monica and asked for 2 weeks to study before the first phone interview.Two weeks later I had the phone interview. I was very nervous but my nerves calmed down as soon as I started talking to the interviewer, he was friendly and the interview felt more like we were a team working on a problem together rather than an interview (to some extent). It was very casual and the problems were interesting. The interviewer gave me a few tips and clues when I got stuck, but overall I felt like I did pretty well.One week later, the recruiter contacted me to announce I passed the phone interview and was invited to an onsite interview at the Santa Monica office. The onsite interview was scheduled for a week after that (so 2 weeks after the phone interview). I arrived at the building, but they have 3 buildings and I showed up at the wrong one! Way to make a good first impression, I felt so stupid. So if you have an interview there, make sure to follow the directions they give you by email instead of googling ""Google Santa Monica"" for the location.The onsite interview consisted of five 45 minutes 1:1 interviews back to back with a lunch with an engineer in the middle. Four of the interviewers were male software engineers in their early 30s, one was older (50s). All of them were nice and friendly and made the experience very pleasant. All but one of the interviewers made me feel like I was already part of the team and that we were just working together on a problem.The lunch was a little more awkward. The guy was older than me (50s) so we didn't have much in common (I am in my late 20s) and he was very hard to talk with. I had some questions and conversation topics ready to make sure the lunch would go smoothly, but I ran through all my questions in about 10 minutes because he only answered with ""yes"", ""no"", or a few words. He never asked me anything or made any effort to keep the conversation going. You could tell he was a nice guy, nothing wrong with him, just not a talker. Seems like a weird choice for a interviewee lunch, the whole thing felt like an uphill battle against awkward silence. The lunch was probably the most stressful part of the whole interview day!At the end of the day, I left the onsite interview feeling confident and happy. The problems had all been interesting and I really did enjoy most of the interviewers. One week later I received an email from the recruiter saying I was not selected for the job. I think I did pretty well, I guess I was not quite quick enough with my answers.",NAN

Google,"Jun 12, 2011",No Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 1 day. I interviewed at Google (New York, NY) in June 2011.","A Google recruiter called me a few months back about having me apply for a Software Engineer position at their New York office. I was already employed in a good job at the time, so I was in two minds about exploring new opportunities. They set up a meeting for me with one of their engineers to clear any doubts or questions I may have about working at Google. This really helped with my decision to interview there, and I indicated to the recruiter that I would like to go ahead and interview with them. An on-site interview was scheduled within three weeks.The interviews started at 10:00AM at the Google offices in Manhattan (since I live in the area, I didn't need to travel, etc.), and were over by 3:00PM. There were 1-on-1 interviews by five of their engineers, each lasted about 45 minutes. One hour was set aside for lunch at the Google cafeteria (where all of the food is free and awesome), and one of their engineers was assigned as my ""host"" at the lunch to answer any questions I may have about life at Google. He also gave me a tour of their offices (which is very cool).All of the interviews were conducted in an ""interview room"" at the Google offices, which is a small meeting room consisting of a single (small) round table and a couple of chairs, a whiteboard and writing supplies. The interviewers (promptly) came to the room at their scheduled times and conducted their interviews for their 45 minutes, or until the next interviewer had arrived outside. Each of the interviews consisted of one or two math or algorithm problems. I was expected to first describe my general approach to the solution. After the interviewer was satisfied with the general approach, I was asked to write code on the whiteboard. I could use any programming language of my choice. I chose Java in almost all questions, and it seemed that most of the interviewers did their day-to-day work in C++. In any case, about half of the time was spent in the back and forth with the interviewer in coming up with the general approach to the problem -- I would come up with an approach, and the interviewer would point about certain cases that didn't work (or other conditions that needed to be met). The other half of the time was spent in planning and writing out the code on the whiteboard.Despite my background in research, none of the questions pertained to my background and experience. The questions were all designed to gauge fundamental problem-solving and algorithms expertise. It seemed like the interview questions were devised completely independently of my resume/background.Finally, during the last 15 minutes (2:45PM-3:00PM), I had a short ""debrief"" session with the HR guy, who gave me the opportunity to ask him any final questions I may have had, and to give him a little feedback about my experience that day.

I said, ""If not now, when?"" and 60 seconds later I got a call from the recruiter. We talked for 45 minutes and mostly it seemed like just fun chitchat. She asked about my experience and what I liked to work on and what languages I preferred. Then she said she would find an engineer suitable for me and would call me back soon. She called the next day and we scheduled a phone interview (tech screen) for the following week. She also send me an email about what to expect and things to brush up on.The next week I got the call from an engineer. We worked together in a Google Doc, and on the phone. He asked me about my resume, particularly my machine language experience. Then we did a bit manipulation problem, and I missed an obvious optimization. Then he asked me the main problem which was very clever. I came upon the solution very quickly, using recursion, but I screwed up on the complexity analysis. Afterwards, we chatted about Google life. It was a fun experience, but I figured I had blown it.I got a call from the recruiter an hour later telling me that the feedback was positive and that we would move on to the on-site interview. I spent a month in front of my white board practicing problems, especially from Gayle Laakmann's book, Cracking the Coding Interview. I read through Introduction to Algorithms , but there was just too much information in there to cram into my brain.At one point I was worried about my low 2.2 GPA and asked if I would be given a chance to explain the situation. I sent them an email and 30 seconds later one of the recruiters called me and said, basically, no one cares about your GPA. I get the impression that it's just a metric they use if there's nothing else on your resume to judge you by.I am not going to describe the interviews here. Sorry. Not only did I sign an NDA, but I also don't want to spoil it for anyone. I will just say this much: Those people who said, ""They asked me a simple CS101 question and I answered it and they still didn't hire me, those arrogant pricks!"", well, dude you completely missed the point of the exercise. It's really not about getting the ""right"" answer.The interviewers were all very cool. Some were reserved, and some were friendly and outgoing. I had a very fun time, but I missed a lot of simple things, didn't complete all of the problems, made simple syntax errors, and completely fumbled the interview that focused on Java. I left depressed, but feeling like I had been given a very fair chance.I got a call from a recruiter two days later saying that the interview feedback was ""pretty positive"" and that he decided to forward it to the Hiring Committee. The following Monday the Hiring Committee gave me a ""unanimous thumbs up"". Another recruiter emailed me to say she would be contacting my references and my application would go through the Compensation Committee and the Executive Committee. I was given a questionnaire to fill out, asking about past employment details and such. It also asked about any past achievements I may want the Executive Committee to know about. They said I would probably hear something in the next few weeks.Getting close to the end of the two week period, at 10:30pm, I got the email to ""extend me an offer"". When I replied to the email, she saw I was still awake so she called me on my cell phone at 11pm to give me the details as soon as possible. And the details were VERY generous, so I did not negotiate.Overall, it was an awesome experience. Everyone was super nice and polite. The whole thing took two months, but a month of that was me asking for time to prepare. I've heard of cases where they can push it through in two weeks if you re really in a hurry. They kept asking me if I had any time constraint that they needed to work with. Also, yes, I asked, and Larry Page did review and sign off on my final approval. From his own words, he's gotten so good at it that it takes him less than a minute for each one.I will only give this advice about the actual interview process: If you thought you aced it, you probably missed something. It's not about getting the ""right"" answer. It is about soooo much more. But, like I said, I don't want to spoil the fun."," Design an algorithm to do X, then analyse the complexity.   Answer Question"

Soon after talking on the phone with the recruiter, a phone screen was scheduled. Did well, and within 2 weeks, an onsite was arranged. Although, the question quality and interviewers were great, I found the Google interview very unorganized. Sure, Google does not want interviewers to talk to each other to avoid spreading the influence. That is good. But there needs to be some coordination before hand. For example, I interviewed for a developer role, and none of the questions asked to me were on design/problem solving. About 80% questions required recursion use, and some were arcane (reverse polish notation, twisted graph).I dont know what Google interviewers measure by asking such questions. To an extent, they were good questions (could not find any in book), but when 80% of questions require recursion use (discouraged in any production quality code), they test little about candidate's suitability for a job. I even gave the feedback to the recruiter, and she was nice enough to acknowledge the issue.Although, I did not get an offer (fumbled on a couple of questions, including RPN) - I find the interview very intellectually stimulating."," Given a graph, find if it represents a tree.   3 Answers"

I interviewed at Google (Mountain View, CA) in August 2011.","I've been contacted by their recruiters every 6 months or year for the past 6 or 7 years. Finally I was in the right place in my career to actually interview there, so I agreed.The first step was a phone interview. The recruiter suggested a whole lot of studying material. I kinda skimmed ""Programming Interviews Exposed"", but I don't think it really made much of a difference at any point in the interview process. I feel like you either know your CS fundamentals or you don't and reading a book about them at the last minute isn't going to help much. Maybe I'm wrong.This is my best tip for interviewing!: don't just discount your first answer because you think it's ""too obvious""! It very well might be the right answer, and now you'll be lost searching for an even better answer that doesn't exist! If you think it's not right, just say ""there might be a better way to do this, but I'm just brainstorming"", and then explain what you're thinking. If there's a better way to do it, they'll let you know. I made this mistake twice in my interviews.First there was a 45 minute phone interview. It was just two questions, one coding, and one more conceptual. It was pretty straightforward. The coding one was just something basic like implementing a binary search with a few tweaks.Despite all the scary things people say, I felt like the in-person interview wasn't especially difficult, but I probably just lucked out with the group of interviewers I pulled. My friend told me he knows a ton of really smart people who didn't pass the in-person, so I shouldn't take it personally if I didn't either. That helped me relax and realize I just had to go in there and do my best and see what happened. I wasn't really nervous then and the interview mostly just felt like I was discussing interesting problems with co-workers. I think being relaxed really helped me get the job, so if you can... chill out. :)Then things got really boring. At this point, it had been six weeks since I first started talking to the recruiter. Within three days, I was told that I'd passed the hiring committee. And after the I didn't get the offer for FOUR AND A HALF MORE WEEKS. That's 2.5 months total. The recruiter was very nice and apologetic about the whole process, but I feel like they need to do something to speed it up.

I won't list of exact questions due to NDA which I would like to respect, but will outline areas - see (*).Some quick background on myself: new grad with masters in computer science.Although I did not receive an offer in the end, it was a great experience and Google left me with a very positive impression about them. Albeit, the entire process was overall on the slow side, but my HR contact was very responsive to emails and kept me up-to-date.I applied online on the company website. About a week later, I got an email to schedule two back-to-back phone interviews in < a week. Second one was rescheduled last minute to next week. Both phone interviewers went very smoothly and the interviewers were very polite and easy to speak with. Each were an hour in length, with maybe the first 10-15 minutes of resume questions, background, etc., then it quickly became technical. I coded in a shared Google Doc for both. The first interviewer asked for whatever language (I chose C++), but the second one insisted on Python (which I was happy to oblige, it's actually my favorite to hack in). I had those two on my resume, so I assume they were probing me to see if I was lying. They will not ask you anything not on your resume and conversely, don't lie/exaggerate as if one of the largest tech. companies doesn't encounter that on a daily basis!***** I haven't seen any of the questions they asked here on Glassdoor, but were similar in complexity. 1st phone interview in C++: was asked to design and code a data structure with specific customization to a queue, big-O analysis, optimization, and short discussions on two other problems (no code due to time constraint). 2nd phone interview: manipulating lists in Python, write some SQL queries (simple selects with joins) for a DB schema he pasted into the doc, also answered some high-level conceptual questions on data structures. Made a small error in one of the SQL queries that I quickly corrected, but pretty much got the rest without help. With that said, couldn't answer the last sub-question in each interview, but they both said it was more of a bonus at that point.Within an hour of the second phone interview, got an email saying they were impressed and decided to move on to onsite interview. This is the part that took a while, almost three weeks just to get it finalized, but it did go smoothly.They put me in a nice hotel for two nights which provided breakfast and a shuttle limo (yes, limo) to/from the Googleplex. The office was very nice, the whole dot-com atmosphere still in full swing. Cubicles looked a bit cramped though compared with other places I've seen. Four people sharing one big cube. I've had larger, private cubicles in past internships at other places. Not a big deal though, I guess. Food was fantastic, better than the crap I regularly eat anyways.My big day lasted four hours consisting of 4 one-on-ones each about 45 minutes and a one hour lunch meeting (not evaluated) with a senior who would answer whatever questions I had and gave me a tour of the campus. All interviewers were very nice and helpful and really do try to push you in the right direction - some more than others, naturally. Perhaps one came off as a bit arrogant at times, but still helpful. Another implicitly told me he wasn't into his duties, but ironically was the most fun to speak with.***** I guess here's what most people want: Two interviewers asked resume questions for maybe 5 minutes, but other than that everything was purely technical: writing code on a whiteboard. The questions ranged from binary search trees (recursion), caching, string manipulation and some random recursion (I got an easy one). Usually asked to design test cases at end (no code). They were not very difficult, but it was clear that you really had to know them inside-out. Be sure to constantly talk and explain what you are thinking. Much better than long periods of silence which I had a few times. I couldn't solve a corner (admittedly important) case for the BST question, and my design for the specialized caching question was not too impressive but it did work; other than that, I pretty much solved the rest without hints. Any time left-over is given to you to ask them whatever you'd like.Went to hiring committee, but alas, two weeks later got the disappointing email they were not going to extend me an offer. HR contact encouraged me to reapply after a year of industry experience, which, depending on my situation at that time, I will consider.

I interviewed at Google (Mountain View, CA) in January 2012.","You're not going to find my actual interview questions here, I signed an NDA and do take it seriously. On the other hand there's plenty of these kind of questions on this site and others. If you can work toward a solution on a good percentage of these, you should send in your resume.The recruiting process is quite slow, involving several stages. I was first contacted by a recruiter, we talked for about 15mn and established a profile of my skillset. This is basically ""how would you rate yourself at such and such tasks"". The recruiter was very nice and really seemed to be trying to understand where I was coming from, and what I could offer to the company. Two weeks later, I had a 45mn phone interview with a software engineer who asked actual coding questions. This was done over a google notebook document, so he could see what I was typing in realtime. I felt that those questions were easier than what I was expecting (we had an extra 15mn at the end, which we used to chat informally about what it's like to work at google) . Several weeks after this, I was invited to interview onsite (mountain view). This was the most grueling stage, five back-to-back 45mn 1-on-1 interviews filled with coding problems of varied difficulty (with a lunch break at one of the restaurants, where the food is free... they'll try to find someone with interests similar to yours to babysit you). Some of the questions were not very hard, and were basically checking that I knew what I said I knew. Some questions were quite hard, and I had to really pause, think (and explain my thought processes), attack the problem as I could, then try to find better ways to solve it. When I got a bit stuck, some interviewers asked pointed questions (which you really have to take as hints), and some others would just let me sweat on my own. Each interview had basically one to three questions/problems, some incrementally more complex, building on the previous one, some completely disconnected from one another. This was very stressful to me, probably more than it should have been. If you can keep a cool head and a smile, you're halfway there, the other half is actually giving good solutions. Now it's not like the difficult questions are VERY difficult, they're just difficult enough that you have to work for it. If you are a pretty good programmer, know your CS basics (expecially complexity analysis) and are able to write code on a whiteboard without getting lost, there's no reason not to make it. The language you actually use didn't seem to matter, although if you chose C++, you should really know STL, if you chose javascript, you should really know your string and array classes, and so on.Be aware that there are many stages of review once you're done interviewing, and that google has an incredibly high rate of false negatives. You may have done well in an area for which you're not being considered, you may have been boxed into a profile which isn't accurate, and so on, so don't jump to conclusions even if you feel you did really well. Some of my friends who I would *definitely* rate as better programmers than I am have failed for no good reason, even after being told by their recruiter that they did a good job, so be aware of that.One advice I'll give: do not embelish your resume, don't say you're an expert at something unless you are, you *will* be probed. If they're interested in you, your references, degrees and previous professionnal experience will be thoroughly checked. Don't be too modest either, I know of someone who didn't pass the first non-technical interview because he rated himself too low on some things. Be honnest, and If you'd honnestly not rate yourself higher than a 6 or 7/10 at something, don't apply for a position that depends on it.Another advice: brush up! Go back to your CS basics and do a good number of problems of the kind you'll find here. A month training on algorithms could definitely make the difference between making it and not.I had to wait for over a month before getting an actual answer. The recruiter was not always keeping me informed about the process but to be fair, there's only so many times one can apologize for the time it's taking. Also, the way potential hires find their ways to an actual team is a bit peculiar. Basically once they know they want you, they still need to find a team that likes your profile, so you may not know until some time which team you may end up with at the end of the process. On the other hand, this gives the recruiter a chance to actively try to find a good fit for you.Total time between being contacted and getting an offer: about 3 months. YMMV.In retrospect I had a pretty good experience with the whole thing. Even if it was frustrating at times, I felt like the recruiter was really working toward getting me hired."," Algorithms, complexity analysis, CS basics, thinking on your feet, whiteboard coding.

I interviewed at Google (Mountain View, CA) in January 2012.","I applied through New Graduate program and a recruiter contacted me within a week. I was scheduled for two back to back phone interviews on the same day. I used glassdoor, Steve Yegge's blogs, and couple of other resources for the preparation along with going through my college data structure course material again.Before my first interview, I was quite nervous (which didn't help later on). The interviewer started with some questions about my prior experience. Then he gave me a programming question: Find the maximum consecutive sum of integers in an array. If I have an array A = [-1,1,2,3,4,5,0], the sum is 15 but for A=[-1,2,4,-5,10,-1] the sum is 16. I asked the interviewer if I could try out few examples on paper but he insisted that everything should be done on Google Doc which was kinda tough for me as I'm more of a design through examples person. My mistake was to start churning out code without properly thinking through the solution and testing it against few examples. My first solution didn't work. My 2nd mistake was to totally switch my approach to recursive from iterative, which didn't turn out well. In the end, I couldn't solve it in time and more importantly, my process for solution was quite embarrassing. By the end of the interview, I knew I had screwed up my chance.For 2nd phone interview, which was 10 minutes after the first, I was quite relaxed for some reason. The interviewer was also very friendly. He asked me some basic questions about my experience along with some questions about hash tables and OS concepts. For the programming part, he asked me to implement an iterator class for list of lists. The idea was the give user a seamless experience for iteration while keeping track of multiple lists, which may even be empty. I was able to complete this implement and test this class easily though the interviewer did point out couple of syntax errors (wrong naming convention for java functions).Though the 2nd interview went good, I didn't do well at all in the first.

Google,"May 8, 2012",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"The process took 1 day. I interviewed at Google (Mountain View, CA) in November 2011.","I did my interviews in November 2011. All the questions were related to Algorithms and I had to solve a given problem, comment on its running time, implement it in the language of my choice on a whiteboard and then improve it further. Although I was quite nervous about the interviews, but I noticed that having a little chat with the recruiter in the interview room before my interviews started definitely calmed me down. I started off well and then the momentum carried on and I was able to perform much better because of not being nervous.I was informed early January that I had passed all the hiring committees. After that, it took number of months (about 4.5) for them to find a matching team for me. I think this is the most painful part in the whole process, because you are in kind of limbo if a match has not been found yet. While passing the technical interviews is a reason to celebrate, it soon becomes clear that you have to wait until a team is found, which can vary on case by case basis.Finally, they found a match for me and I talked to the manager over the phone. He explained all the details about the kind of work being done in the team. I got super-excited by the details of the work and therefore expressed my interest. In the end, after all the wait, I am happy that at least I have been matched to a team that I really would like to work in."," Can not mention specific questions due to NDA and I don't think it would help either. The main thing, however, is to have solid fundamentals. Know your algorithms, data structures and discrete math. Before the interview, make sure you get comfortable writing code on a whiteboard or a piece of paper. We are so used to writing code on the computer that when we switch to a whiteboard, our brain does not accept the fact that any code written on the board would be useful :P. I think that if you do enough practice on the whiteboard, it would only make it easier for you in the interview. Having done all the technical preparation, the most important thing is not to be nervous during the interview and practicing on the whiteboard certainly does help in that regard.   2 Answers"

Google,"Mar 31, 2013",No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,I applied through a recruiter. The process took 9+ months. I interviewed at Google in February 2012.,"For the reading impatient, in a nutshell: I found the interview process (non-US citizen) extremely long, very tedious, and in a sense dehumanizing (in your phone interviews you get your code questions, write the answers and very little else matters). Overall, the whole ordeal was very life draining, and comparing with peers that were going through it at the same time (as I later learned), very focused on a specific type of developer/engineer: without exception very experienced people were rejected.Google can hire whom they please, but if they know the profile of the person they want to hire, why bother contacting people with 10+ years of experience only to reject them all later? It's a waste of time for them and the interviewees even more so. One could arguably say that it is disrespectful as well.For those caring for all the details: I was contacted by a recruiter mid 2012, asking if I was interested in discussing a position. I'm not a US citizen, so I was dumbfounded. Of couse I was interested, but why would they contact me then? (I had sent a resume to Google Brasil years prior, with no response).So a month after I responded I finally heard back, and we agreed because of the project I was in and their timelines to start the process in December. Apparently someone had recommended me, and wanted to remain anonymous. So here we had about 5 months worth of time that I took to practice Portuguese again, brush up my resume with competitions, study, and get Android experience.During that time, I started to learn that certain other people in my country had also been contacted, some with a similar set of skills and experience. So clearly there was a larger, coordinated effort going on, not just an interest in myself, this made sense but it also made me more wary of it.December came and I contacted the recruiter once more, and they requested that we start the process in January. So New Years' studying and January came, and finally got a call. I was expecting a technical interview at once, but got another screening (similar to the one the year before) instead. After some email back and forth, a coding interview was scheduled for mid February.The interview itself was a coding problem of some calculations, and I thought I blew it. To my surprise I was contacted again the next week, and another interview set for the beginning of March.That one started by the engineer unable to call my phone, I had to call him international, and explain how to call me. Some 15 minutes were spent there. So finally I got some web system design and scalability questions, that (with guidance mind you) I think I answered successfully. I felt much better after that interview.But weeks rolled by with no response, I was a nervous wreck, so I wrote back asking what the status was (as April was a deadline for H1B), and eventually I got a response that because of the engineer's feedback the process was over for me. I honestly appreciated getting the response, but obviously was not happy.I was taken aback, but what surprised me even more was that engineers that I consider better than myself, were also getting interviews and also didn't get a lot further. The pattern seemed to be people with plenty of experience (10+ years), multiple team positions, and a history of leadership as well. A pattern hard to ignore.In the end, like I said, the experience was very life draining, I would not enter into it again lightly.

Google,"Apr 26, 2013",No Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,I applied through a recruiter. The process took 3+ weeks. I interviewed at Google in April 2013.,"Got two emails from a Google recruiter based on academic institutions I had listed in my Google+ profiles.I gave the recruiter a call and he called me back the same day. We had a 20 minute conversation about my current experience and about what I was looking for in a future job. He then said he would like to set up an interview in the next couple of weeks. He also requested I send him a copy of my resume.8 days later I got an email from an interview coordinator. The interview was setup for 6 days from when this interview coordinator contacted me.The interview was to be conducted over the phone and use a Google doc. I sent an email back to the interview coordinator asking if I could setup a Google hangout interview instead, since I don't have a headset that attaches to my phone, but I do have a webcam and headset that attach to my computer. (I watched an interview preparation video on the Google jobs page that suggested that I have a headset, and not to use speaker phone). The interview coordinator sent me instructions for the Google hangout interview; these instructions said the interviewer would contact me with the URL for the hangout.I spent the weekend before my interview preparing, I practiced coding every sort and search function, some patterns that I haven't used in a while, etc., as I finished my undergrad 5 years ago, and expected the interview to be quite academic, based on feedback I've read on this site. Also reviewed OO principles, etc. I thought I would be in pretty good shape for the interview.The time for my interview came around, and no email from the interviewer containing the Google hangout link. I figured I would give the interviewer 10 minutes before I took any action. 15 minutes later, still no email. So I emailed my recruiter. I got an email back from him almost immediately saying he would contact the interviewer. I then got an email from the interviewer with the hangout link. I clicked the link and it said I did not have permission to join the hangout. I also noticed the interviewer had not joined the hangout. I then got a call from the interviewer. He said that he hadn't ever used hangout before in an interview and so we should just do the interview over the phone, as that was his preference. I asked him to give me a minute to try to get the audio worked out on my end as his voice was muffled to the point I could barely understand him. Nothing I did fixed this, so I asked him if he was on speaker, he said ""yes"". I asked him if he could go off of speaker because I couldn't hear him. He did and then I could hear him perfectly, but both of us had to hold our phones, which was quite uncomfortable.He continued by saying that he just had one question for me, and that it would probably take me the duration of the interview to complete. He pasted a java function into the Google doc (as I am most familiar with java). He explained briefly what the function was supposed to do, but said there were errors in the code and that it didn't currently accomplish the goal and that he wanted me to identify and fix the errors.I won't specify what the code did, but I will specify that it dealt with a domain I was only vaguely familiar with. I started walking through the code with the interviewer to understand the flow of data through the function. The code was quite simple, and with some help from the interviewer identified the first issue. The issue was an incorrect mathematical function. For example the line of code was supposed to produce f(x) = y, but it was not producing y. The function was not difficult, but I couldn't figure out what the mathematical manipulation of variables should be to produce the desired outcome. The interviewer then went on to say that we had only 15 minutes left in the interview, and that we should move onto to see if we can find more issues. So we stepped through some more code assuming the first issue was working correctly. Then I found the next issue, it was exactly like the previous issue. This time the function was a little simpler, but still not something you could solve in less than 5 minutes. I tried a few different things, talking the interviewer through exactly what I was thinking. Then the interviewer said that our time was up, but that he would give me an extra five minutes to solve the current function, as I was getting pretty close. In the five minutes, I solved that function. He then asked if I had any questions about Google that would be appropriate for an engineer that it was likely the recruiter couldn't answer. I asked two questions and then we ended the call.",Come up with a mathematical function that produces f(x) = y for multiple functions found in a given chunk of code for some random domain.   Answer Question

Well, let's do interviews!I contacted my intern recruiter asking for a full-time job opportunity, and s/he quickly referred me to the recruiter responsible for that. Since I was a former intern my phone screen was waived (had two 45-minute screens when applying for internship), and my former intern host was asked to provide a feedback. I was asked to do a job talk (as a PhD) followed by 4 rounds of interviews, 2 research and 2 engineering.The job talk was 45-minutes followed by 15 minute questions.

After that it was a casual lunch with my intern host, so I devoted every minute enjoying the food.The two research interviews were conducted by people familiar with the field, and had challenging questions on the overall understanding. I found it very exciting as both of us would get involved into discussion about the state-of-the-art.

Fortunately for me, I was going to the LA area so they were nice enough to allow me to interview in person, but still with 2 pre-screens and then the next level. I am going to adhere to the agreement of holding the questions to myself but this is what I took away from it:Know your data structures. Do not only know them and how to use them, know how to think in depth about speed, best choices and why for any situation. Software Engineering is a big field like automobiles. To build a car to make sure that it has the best fuel efficiency, top speed and can handle all maximum conditions is totally different from fixing bugs, adding features and building components.

Google,"May 28, 2013",No Offer,Neutral Experience,Difficult Interview,I applied in-person. I interviewed at Google in April 2013.,"I've applied to the job, using Goggle's career website by sending my resume. I got a call from the recruiter shortly after my application. The communication of the recruiter was good and prompt.We scheduled a phone interview and it took them 3-4 days to get back to me with the result. Unfortunately, I couldn't pass the phone screen. I am first asked a programming question: Design and implement a class, which returns a random string value from a set with an arbitrary probability distribution given by an array of probabilities. Using an existing random number generator with a uniform distribution(e.g., Random.nextFloat()), you return the string for the random float value based on the strings probability distribution. This sounds hard because of the wording, but it was easy to implement."," After I completed the coding question, we had plenty of time and I am asked a bunch of floating point numbers related questions.1. Given an array of floats. you have a sum function that takes the float array as input, but it returns a different result every time you change the order of the float numbers in the array, why?2. How does the floating point numbers are represented in binary?3. How to add two floating point numbers in binary?The answers to these questions lie in the The IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic (IEEE 754) and you can find sources online.I got really frustrated with these serious of questions, because they have nothing to the with the coding interview.

Google,"Nov 30, 2012",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 8 weeks. I interviewed at Google (Mountain View, CA) in November 2012.","Have interviewed in person with Google several times over the years most recently in Nov 2012. Have never gotten an offer. I will honor my agreement w/Google not to reveal specific interview questions, but they tend to be generic computer science-type questions. As someone who is at mid-career it is disappointing to be asked questions that might be more appropriate for an intern applying for their first summer job. I felt I had a lot to contribute but the interview process doesn't focus on anything besides just basic coding questions.Google contacted me by phone for a conversation with a recruiter. The technical phone screen step was waived and I was invited in for an in person interview a few weeks later. Five technical interviews plus lunch.I felt I did well on the technical questions but the whole atmosphere of the process seemed a bit negative. When I interview I like it to be with people who are clearly inspired by and excited to work for their company. I just didn't get that sense from these people--they had no passion to work for Google. The person who took me to lunch actually made clear to me that he was very unhappy working for Google.A positive interview experience is one where I come away from it inspired to work for the company--and then if I don't get the job, it is a disappointment because I won't be working there. With Google the disappointment is more that I feel I wasted a day of my time there. I ended up thinking that I would use a Google offer--had it been forthcoming--more for leverage in negotiating a slightly sweeter deal with my current employer--where I'm actually mostly happy. When I was thinking in those terms even before hearing Google's negative decision, it seems clear that Google failed in motivating me to want to work for them.Upon reflection, my basic take away was that I didn't really interview for a position at Google. Instead, they conducted a very, very generic tech interview which could just as easily have been an interview for any other tech company, be it another large company or a startup. Absolutely zero information was revealed that would allow me to determine whether this might have been a suitable match for me. Google seems to be counting on their name and reputation to attract good candidates and they seem to feel they don't have to really put anything into the process themselves. It's hard to feel excited about working for a company when their interview process is just a generic imitation of the interview process at many, many other tech companies I've interviewed with in my career.Speaking only for myself, Google's name and reputation will probably always be enough to get me to invest a big chunk of a day with an interview. But Google seems to expect more than that--they seem to expect a significant investment of time in preparing for the interview as well. I'll admit I probably didn't prepare as hard as I might have for this interview and that may have been a factor in the outcome. However, as an experienced professional with limited time, I need a reason to believe that the investment of time in preparation is worthwhile. Google, unfortunately, gave me no reason to be enthusiastic about the process so that I'd put the time in. Again--at least in my case--it will take more than just relying on their good name to get me excited about working for them.",Can't due to NDA signed.   1 Answer

Google,"Apr 15, 2015",No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 4+ weeks. I interviewed at Google (Mountain View, CA) in August 2014.","The process began with a recruiter on LinkedIn contacting me after viewing my profile. The first phone screen was with the recruiter and seemed to be directed towards ""placement"" in the company. Questions involved things like ""Do you like front end or back end coding more?"", ""What is the time complexity of QuickSort?"", ""How would you estimate some large exponential function?"". There were 0 questions regarding experience or resume information.The second phone screen was with a technical interviewer within the company. The phone connection was awful, the speakerphone on Google's end increased the awfulness, the poor English of the interviewer increased the awfulness even more, and the lack of respect and attentiveness of the interviewer was the icing on the awful cake.The interviewer was not interested in any discussion of my experience or resume at all. He began by asking an esoteric math related programming problem. I frequently asked questions of the interviewer and was met with no response. At some point, I thought the phone dropped out because of 2 minutes of silence even after I asked multiple times if the interviewer was still there. Eventually, the interviewer said he had to leave to use the bathroom while I was struggling and asking questions. He didn't return for 15 minutes. After my time was up, the interviewer said ""OK, time is up, good bye"" and hung up on me. This isn't how a company as large as Google should be conducting interviews.After notifying the recruiter of the poor interview, she set me up with a third phone screen. The third phone screen had a much more attentive and polite interviewer. Again, no questions regarding experience or resume information were asked. We began immediately by working in a Google Docs window about solving a path finding problem. Google Docs is really bad with code formatting and syntax highlighting, so it was a bit of a nightmare to type out a solution. I left this interview feeling a little better.The final part of the process was to schedule onsite interviews in Mountain View, CA. I was bounced between 2-3 different recruiters and a third party travel agency, so coordinating the travel was frustrating. I'm surprised my application wasn't lost during all the transfers. The onsite process was similar to other tech companies in the sense that there was a long, full day of interviews. In total, there were 6 interviews across a 7 hour period with a lunch interview shoved in there somewhere. Many of the interviewers seemed to be bored or not interested in conducting interviews, so it was a similar experience as my second phone screen. I get the feeling that Google forces their engineers to perform interviews but doesn't hold them accountable to the quality of their interview process. In addition, many interviewers spoke poor English and couldn't successfully communicate the problem that I was required to solve. And finally, I was never asked experience or resume related questions.

Google,"Apr 12, 2015",Accepted Offer,Neutral Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied online. The process took 3+ months. I interviewed at Google (Mountain View, CA) in March 2015.","This is the experience of someone who lives 2000 miles away from Google's Mountain View campus. I applied online and heard back in less than a week. The HR phone interview went well so I got a technical phone interview.They gave me a study sheet that lists everything you might need to know for the technical portion of the interview, which is loads of computer science theory, algorithms and data structures and such. I highly suggest studying this! It is the kind of stuff that you don't normally know offhand but you can brush up on it pretty easily if you knew it at one point. If you have to learn these things fresh then you've got to do it, but I don't think you'll be successful in the interview because it's got to come like second nature. I had plenty of time between the HR phone interview and the technical phone interview, so I spent that time diligently reviewing the things I should know. They are not out to trick you, they sincerely want you to be well prepared for the interview because even great candidates fail simply because they didn't take the time to prepare. The phone interview went well and I felt the interviewer really took time to read my resume and ask thoughtful questions. The questions were not too difficult, and they even gave me 5 minutes to talk about a job that interested them on my resume which was non-technical in nature. If you know how to code and solve simple puzzles you should do fine. I even made some technical mistakes like not being able to find the most efficient solution and I struggled through a question about a hypothetical project management scenario (that question came out of left field, and I stammered and stumbled through the last few minutes giving my answer).3 weeks later they flew me out for 2 nights to the on-site interview. I should mention it wasn't a ""normal"" on-site interview, because apparently it was some kind of major hiring event called a ""batch day"". In terms of the interview itself it was the same as they always do, but what was abnormal was the sheer number of people they had on-site for interviews. I never found out how many there were, but in my building alone there were close to 20 that I saw, and there were loads more candidates walking around campus during lunch time. The on-site consisted of 5 separate 45 minute interviews, each with a different interviewer. I say it was difficult because the questions cover advanced technical subject matter that will be difficult to the majority of engineers. However, if you're the superstar they're looking for the questions will not be that difficult, and may even be fun to solve. I think it's safe to say that if you think any of the questions are difficult and/or you spend the whole 45 minutes writing your solution then you're probably answering the wrong way. They like to test if you know a CS concept by asking generic questions and seeing if you identify the proper data structures or algorithms to use. For example, if your algorithm is wasting time (and whiteboard space) to keep a collection sorted, it could be because you didn't recognize that the full ordering doesn't matter and you should be using a priority queue instead. Those kinds of identifications are major things they're looking for.A week after the on-site I found out the hiring committee approved me. That's when they called my references and a couple weeks later I spoke with various engineering managers who were interested in my skills and background. They didn't care that I had no experience doing what they do, because they knew I was a skilled coder from the interview notes and I'm smart enough to figure it out on the fly. This part is not an interview, just a conversation about interests. They want to find out if you're going to enjoy working on their project, not if you're smart enough or have the right experience - they already vetted that in the on-site interview. In my case I talked with 3 managers who all had different and interesting work, which made it difficult to decide, but ultimately I got to choose which project to join because they all were a great fit.A week after being placed with a team, they wrote up my offer and put it to the VP and senior VP reviews. The waiting is the most stressful thing, because at this point there's practically no reason they're going to reject you, but you have to wait so long for the offer to finally come. Be patient, there is light at the end of the tunnel! After the offer was reviewed by the top execs I got it by e-mail, set my start date and digitally signed it.

The interview itself was standard coding in a Google Doc of some algorithms. I tried to follow the suggestions in Cracking the Coding Interview, but ended up doing worse trying to over analyze the situation.The phone call quality was absolutely terrible.

While the recruiter was very prompt in reaching out to me in the beginning, they were pretty slack in responding to my further follow-ups. In fact, I'm certain that I got done in less than three months only because I had a couple of counter-offers, and otherwise I could have gone through this process for a few more months. On top of this, there was absolutely no one from recruiting or HR to show me around the campus or to walk me to the exit after the end of the day during my on-site visit.

I interviewed at Google in January 2015.,"I've applied online and met a recruiter at a university event.I'm an Electrical Engineering student that is interested in working as a software engineer. I didn't take any classes in my program to serve that purpose, therefor I self-educated myself. I bought books, did online classes, and took few CS additional classes at my university. With that said, I had to focus a lot on learning what any CS student must know, and I did that, but that didn't make me a perfect candidate yet. In my first phone interview, the only one I had, I managed to answer almost all of the questions. However, I found out that I lacked the ability to be a great user of the Java API and abilities when coding solutions. For example, I chose an array as my data structure for the solution, where maybe if I chose a linked list, I would have shown that I'm a stronger programmer.They called me 3 days after my phone interview notifying me that I was not chosen for the second on-site interview. However, the recruiter told me they were impressed by my resume, my analytic skills, and my knowledge in general. He said I need to practice coding more and I will be a great fit. He told me that he'll contact me again at the end of the year and set another interview without me even asking for it.

Google,"Jan 7, 2015",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,I applied through a recruiter. The process took 3 weeks. I interviewed at Google in November 2014.,"CONTEXT:I had been contacted by different Google recruiters over the past few years (and had been referred internally but I didnt know about that) and I had kept asking them to contact me later.FIRST CONTACT:I was then again contacted first for an S.R.E position. The recruiter took a mini 5-10 interview about time complexities and some Linux systems questions which they expected people to be well versed in. The recruiter was a little misleading about what the position was about and made it sound alot closer to S.W.E than it actually is. I did my research spoke with people who interviewed for SRE. I then insisted that I wanted to interview for SWE. The recruiter tried hard to convince me to apply for SRE but my heart was not in it.EVENTUAL CONTACT:After 1-2 conversations with the recruiter, I was then handed over to another recruiter for SWE. I had multiple conversations so that they can ascertain which team should interview me and what should be a good fit. They really do try to set you up for success, I can assure you that much. They were unable to initially be precise about which team I would be a fit for. So they suggested that I atleast do the phone interview (which would be reaosonably generic) and then that would give them some clues.PHONE INTERVIEW STAGE:I gave the phone interview and next day got an email that they want to move forward. I then spoke with a different recruiter who was supposed to handle my case. I again had some clarifying conversations with her about my strengths and interests and made sure that my onsite interview would be something that I expected it to be. This recruiter was fantastic and very detail oriented.I had limited time because I had 2 existing offers whose deadlines were approaching. They scheduled my interview on a day of my choosing.ONSITE INTERVIEW STAGE:The onsite interview went well. The interviewers were friendly and polite. Some young, some slightly older. They were excited to be a part of Google. I had a great time talking and solving questions.The interview questions were not very difficult. I concentrated alot on code organization, cleanliness and correctness. Debugging my code in the interviews and convincing myself and the interviewer of the absolute correctness was very important.If you are comfortable with recursion, Dynamic programming, Arrays, Trees etc that should be fine. I dont think they really wanted to test knowledge of advanced concepts. They concentrated more on basic fundamentals, good solutions, clean & correct code.There were 5 technical interviews and 1 lunch interview. The lunch interview was not technical. It was me who was asking the constant questions in that time.POST INTERVIEW STAGE:Since I was on a tight timeline, things moved at LIGHTNING SPEED. I couldnt imagine that it was possible for this to be done so soon.On the SAME DAY of my interview, I got a positive response and my packet for the Hiring Committee was being prepared. They checked out my references the NEXT day and by nightfall the next day, I knew I was approved by the hiring commitee.OFFER PHASE:The verbal offer was given 2 days later. 2 days of negotiation. I was given the final written letter basically within a week of my interview which I signed.Over all:The recruiter was diligent and FAST. I couldnt keep up, it was that quick. I was very lucky I would say to work with the right people. I made sure i myself was prompt at every stage."," I cannot disclose the questions.

This will help in not wasting the candidates time/money and theirs.The onsite consisted of 5 sessions. The first two were dictionary and bit manipulation questions. The third was a question about how to design a system that handles and logs the urls clicked on. The last two were pretty tough graph questions for someone who does not deal with graphs in his daily work. Know the usual graph algorithms.

He also presented several things incorrectly, such as initially calling a list of numbers a set, which implies no repetitions, but later changing his mind to just a list.

I had interviewed before for an internship and January but I did not get an offer. The recruiter told me that she found my resume in their database. Since I wasn't prepared to interview at that time, I asked my recruiter if I can give my phone interview in July. The recruiter agreed and asked me to remind her in June.I reminded the recruiter in June and I was scheduled for a phone interview in July. The recruiter gave me lots of topics to prepare. They mostly covered all the basics of Computer Science I studied in my undergraduate and graduate school. The phone interview took place using a shared Google Doc. I was asked 2 pretty simple questions which I coded and tested within 30 mins. However, there was a huge communication gap between me and my interviewer. The interviewer was not a native English speaker and was not able to understand my explanations. I was pretty disappointed as I thought that I messed it up even though it was no fault of mine. (Note: This was the only negative experience throughout my process and it was completely overshadowed by the positive experiences later). The recruiter called me the following day and told that they wanted me to have a second phone interview as the first interview was inconclusive.I scheduled the second interview a week after. This interview was also on a shared Google Doc and my interviewer told me that the interview will be in two parts, one about CS fundamentals and the second would be some coding. For the first part we did not use the Google Doc and I was asked many questions about Data Structures, Algorithms and Complexity Analysis. The questions will seem very easy if you are well prepared. The coding question was also pretty simple. Two days later I was told that I have cleared the round and they want to schedule my on site interview at Mountain View.I scheduled my interview a month later and the recruiter gave me a lot of material and links to refer for my preparation. The recruiter was extremely helpful and she even wished me luck a day before my onsite. The onsite consisted of 4 technical interviews and a lunch with an engineer. The lunch was not evaluative. All the 4 interviews were white board coding and they tested my coding, algorithm and basic computer science skills. The interviewers were extremely nice. At the end of the day, I was feeling very happy with the level of discussions I was able to have with the interviewers.My recruiter called me about an hour after my last interview to inform that she had already received a couple of interview reviews and they look pretty positive. 3 days later, my recruiter told me that she received all the interview reviews and the comments were very positive and that she would be sending my package to the hiring committee.

The first was a design question. It was intentionally severely underspecified. I had to design object-oriented data structures and an algorithm to solve the problem. Once I solved it the interviewer upped the difficulty by changing the problem parameters a but ""what if the entire input won't fit into memory/on a single machine"". This pattern was typical throughout the day. Two of the remaining interviews were typical algorithms questions such as those seen in Cracking the Coding Interview. The last was a distributed systems design problem with no programming. I had to design a system from scratch, focusing on scalability, reliability, and performance.Once the interview was over I had to wait about a week for the hiring committee to meet. I'm not sure how much this was sped up by already having an offer. They met and gave the thumbs up. This wasn't an offer, but according to the recruiter was almost as good as one. I then met with the managers for three teams that were potential starting teams. These meetings were only 30 minutes so it was tough to decide.

He did not speak fluent english by a long shot. The choppy google voice connection mixed with him being fairly quiet didnt help either. He asked me questions like ""What does it mean"" when pointing to pieces of code, which I answered by explaining what that line did, which was not what he was looking for. In the beginning he also said to ask him any clarifying questions along the way, which I did. I had to repeat myself multiple times and he had trouble answering them in a way that made much sense to me.They are definitely looking for CS Fundamentals. Algorythms, data structures, runtimes, etc. You code in a Google Doc and they dont allow you to run or test your code, so you have to be pretty confident about writing the problem out correctly top to bottom.They didn't care at all about my practical (real world) software development experience, and instead only focused on academic CS fundamentals, as listed above.

Google,"Jul 14, 2015",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"I applied through an employee referral. The process took 4 weeks. I interviewed at Google (Mountain View, CA) in July 2015.","I was contacted by a Google recruiter based on an internal referral from an ex-colleague. Since I already lived in the Bay Area and (apparently) my referrer did a great job talking me up, I was allowed to skip the phone screen stage and proceed directly to the on-site interviews.I went through 5 interviews (45 minutes each) on site, divided as follows: 3 on coding and algorithms, 1 on object-oriented design, and 1 on high-level system design. I also had lunch (1 hour) with an engineer, where I got to sample their famous free food and talk informally about life at Google.Like many other folks, I came in expecting very difficult and brain-warping questions. But to my pleasant surprise, none of the questions were particularly hard at all. The whiteboard coding and object-oriented design problems were really straightforward, very similar to the types of questions you'll get asked at most other major Silicon Valley tech firms. The system design question was a bit trickier, but it was ultimately just an open-ended discussion which felt pretty similar to real-life engineering design discussions that I do frequently at work.I definitely got the feeling that they don't care so much whether you ""solve"" the problem per se, but rather they focus more about how you analyze and approach the problem and how effectively you engage the interviewer in communicating your ideas. Personally, I really enjoyed all my interactions, and felt very engaged and energetic throughout the entire on-site interview day.After the on-site interviews, I received a call the next day from my recruiter, who told me that the feedback looked good and that I would be moved to the hiring committee stage. Within another three days, I was told the good news that I'd cleared the hiring committee (supposedly with flying colors, although perhaps the recruiter was just trying to flatter me!). They then checked my references and asked for details about my current compensation and competing offers. Finally, it took another week after that to do the team matching and receive the formal offer."," Can&#039;t disclose due to NDA. But as mentioned above, I did 3 coding interviews, 1 object-oriented design interview, and 1 high-level system design interview. The coding questions were of just average difficulty; I would say they are no harder than the types of questions asked at most other major Silicon Valley tech firms. Also, one of the coding interviews involved a few knowledge-based questions on Java (which I'd told my recruiter was my most familiar programming language--so they do seem to do some verification of your claimed expertise).   Answer Question"

She finished graduate school within the past five years (I finished graduate school 15 years ago) and had at least 10 years less experience than I did. As part of the interview process the possibility of me working as a manager came up. Ultimately Google decided I didn't have the past experience to justify a management role. I was offered a position as an engineer and I turned it down. Why? Because the interview panel itself told me what kind of ""manager"" google values.

This all sounded like it was going smoothly, but, oh, how wrong I was...The interview itself was challenging but not impossible. I had five interviews, plus a lunch ""interview."" If I remember correctly, there were three interviews before lunch, and then two after, each 45 minutes long. I think I did well in three of the interviews, and two of them I only did okay, maybe a bit below average. I was originally applying for a front-end software engineering position, so two of my interviewers had a few questions focused on the front-end, e.g., CSS, Javascript, event handling, etc. The other three were generic software engineering questions, that you would find in a typical interview. All of the interviewers were very nice and I didn't feel uncomfortable asking them questions, although there's a chance I might've asked too many questions.After the interview, my recruiter told me he would have an update for me by the following week. After a week goes by with no updates, I send him an email only to discover that his email address was no longer active. After some frantic emailing, I found out my recruiter had left for another role without telling anyone, so I was then assigned to another recruiter.Recruiter #2 was very nice, but for about three months, all he could tell me was that they needed more information in order to make a decision, and was very slow to get more information (e.g. asked for references, but didn't contact them until two months later). He eventually set up some project calls for me with four teams, and that went very well. I sent him my preferences of the teams, but he went on vacation for two weeks, so my application went nowhere during that time. He informed me that he was leaving for another role after he got back, and I would be assigned to yet another recruiter.Recruiter #3 (who was awesome, by the way) told me that the hiring committee's schedules were weekly, and so I had to wait a full week between each of the remaining steps for any updates. Because this took so long, the hiring manager of the team I was supposed to be placed in had left for another role (there's a common theme here), and so I had to have more project calls to find another team. After all of this I finally got an offer. I'm not exaggerating that the entire process, since the first message sent by the sourcer to when I got the offer letter, took six months. This was one of the most frustrating hiring processes of my entire life so far. (And maybe in the universe? Who knows?)I still took the job, though."," I won't go into specifics (not that I'd remember them), but for the front end questions, you should be very comfortable with selectors and how to manipulate the elements on a page. There was also some Javascript-related questions about events.For the general engineering questions, I would say it's important to be comfortable with problems regarding 2D arrays (things like boards, keypads, etc.) and graphs/trees.

The recruiter interview was nice -- I was just asked about my interests and why I applied for the position. Pleasant experience. The phone interview was disappointing. I spent two weeks studying very complex algorithms as suggested by the recruiter, and I was prepared with an arsenal of facts and knowledge about data structures and algorithms and LINUX systems and networking and the list goes on. Then, I ended up spending the entire phone interview on one relatively simpleton problem, getting stuck in the nitty gritty details of how to move an index and offset around.

I created a LinkedIn account earlier this year, and within 48 hours I got a phone call to discuss interview opportunities at Google. I was surprised they called me, because I didn't make my number public on LI. Turns out, I had applied to Google 7 years back on their online portal. They never called me back then, but my information was lying around in the system. So now I can confidently say that Google called me back 7 years after I applied, LOL!Anyway, they were pretty happy with my resume/background. The recruiter actually offered to skip the phone interview, and directly call me onsite. Score! We set something up a couple of weeks later. I keep my coding and algorithms skills up to date, since I participate in competitive programming, so I didn't need to prep too much. I think I reviewed mainly the system design portion, because I hate those questions so much!Onsite was a great experience. Funny story, I was waiting in the lobby on the day of my interview.

The interviewers are very knowledgeable, and we kicked around many ideas on how to approach various problems. I got through (solved and coded) about 2 problems per interview. Of all the companies I interviewed with (LI, FB, Google) Google's interview was the most thorough in terms of CS areas. They hit all the major CS areas (dynamic programming, recursion, data structures, randomized algorithms, greedy algorithms, systems programming, graph theory, BSTs etc.). I was expecting this, but the thoroughness really surprised me (especially since other top companies only have 2-3 coding modules). On the flip side, they didn't ask a single thing from my resume (even though I was 10 years experienced). That was surprising as well.Luckily both my coworker and I made it through. I will be moving there next week.My advice for Google interviews is to make sure your algorithms/DS are solid. In addition, coding should be second nature. Once you solve the problem algorithmically, writing code on the whiteboard should be completely mechanical.

We’re interested in your skills and do check for cheating, so please don’t use your professors’, coworkers’, or friends’ solutions or any other external resource for coming up with your answers to the survey or coding questions."" So I used zero external resources. No documentation. Nothing. I thought this was appropriate since you don't get to look up docs during a whiteboard interview.The algorithms themselves were simple. The really, really hard part was not having access to documentation-- one can conjure up algorithms with just one's mind and maybe a pencil and some paper, but it is near impossible to conjure up the correct libraries and methods out of thin air.After an incredibly hard time guessing method names and the like, my time ran out and I was only on the first problem. I completed the problem on my own, using documentation-- 'twas a breeze. I thought to myself, ""It seems silly that an easy problem should be made so difficult by lack of documentation."" I contacted someone at Google and asked them to confirm that ""any other external resources"" included documentation. I was disheartened and surprised to find out that documentation was perfectly okay to use.I told them what had happened and they denied me a second chance but assured me that it wasn't a problem and that everything would be okay if I tried my best...So I was obviously rejected. It's silly, but it's my fault that I had not spoken up before I started the sample.

After matching with a manager and finally being approved by the executive hiring committee, I was extended an offer.My advice to anyone applying is to always stay positive!

In my case it was night and day between the two, the first time was crazy; half way into the process fire-alarm went off, one interviewer was late and came in about to collapse and one spent the first half searching his phone for a question. The second on-site (a year later) went off without a hitch. I was able to solve all the problems given, but with a few stumbles on my part a long the way. With one of my interviewers I got 2 questions I already solved (not with google) so I told him I already got it and verbally explained the solution [don't hesitate to do this, honesty is valued].A few pointers:1.) A few tricks to watch out for:        -Some interview will keep it going to you end. Don't allow time to idle if you solved it. Verbally state that you're trying to see if there's a better solution (again don't idle to long), ask the interviewer if they thing a better solution exist or if they have any other questions or just say that you're done.       -If asked for operation cost, it's rarely o(n), but the problem will give the illusion of it.       -When asked 'what data structure,' be aware they may be asking for a combination like linked list and hash map for quick modification and iteration.2.) Be familiar with collection structures and their methods for your chosen language including the string object.3.) Don't be afraid to isolate things that are more busy work and not at the core of the problem such as asking the interviewer to assume a certain helper methods exist (they obviously have to agree to it first)4.) If you realize you're solution fails, let the interviewer know and why it does and either rework it or start over (it happens). Hoping your interviewer didn't notice is the worst thing to try..... you can probably guess some of these pointers come from some stumbling points that I ran into.

She set up a phone screening with me on a day that I had off work.For background, I am currently employed at another company as a Data Scientist. The contact from the recruiter was 100% initiated by her.When the interviewer initially contacted me, she said that she had several positions open and wanted to gauge my interests and background generally. During the actual phone interview, it quickly became apparent that she had a very specific position in mind as a Software Engineer that she was recruiting for. I even explained during the initial contact that I am happy at my current job and it would take an exceptional offer for which I am a great fit to lure me away. The position she was looking for didn't sound like a good fit for my skills. I even asked her point blank if she had read my resume (probably not) or was just sending bulk messages when she contacted me. She assured me that she thought that I was potentially an excellent fit.The recruiter then asked me a series of technical questions related to the position she obviously had in mind when she called me. I was caught somewhat off guard by the surprise interview (since she had claimed during our initial contact on LinkedIn that she just wanted to learn more about my background) and not in the mood to play along, so I didn't put much effort into answering her questions. It didn't help that the questions were in an area which isn't a good fit with my background, as I made clear earlier in the conversation.After about 10 or so minutes of questions, she abruptly ended the interview by saying, ""I don't think that you're ready for this position "" (duh) and hung up the phone.

The interview scheduling was really inefficient and slow, but at least they were nice.The phone interview was a pretty simple question I had to code up on a Google doc, after which I was asked some followup about how to generalize it to a harder problem. The guy had a very difficult to understand Indian accent and wasn't getting helpful responses to my clarifying questions so I actually solved the wrong problem, but either the phone interview bar is really low or he went back and looked at the GDoc later (I fixed the code afterward) and noticed my corrections.I was invited onsite to my surprise, which was 5 45-minute interviews. Since I'm pretty junior it was all algorithms/coding/data structures and no systems design. Frankly, I found the questions easy and came up with a fast algorithm for all of them very quickly and wrote down code that should be correct, with the exception of one little syntax error I left on the board, and another minor mistake that I caught and corrected. I did a lot of practice coding questions before the interview and had done a close variant of basically everything I was asked.Got a call from the recruiter saying they won't be moving forward because ""coding ability not strong enough"", but she pointed out that some of the interviewers had very positive feedback. Having read about how the applicant scoring process works, I'm having a hard time figuring out what went wrong but I suppose there could have been a number of interviewers who didn't like something and gave me a bad score.Oh well, I thought the lack of behavioral questions meant if I got all the coding right I should pass, guess there's more to it."," A bunch of fairly simple questions with string manipulations you can probably find on leetcode and such, some tree questions, etc. If you do a bunch of review questions covering the usual data structures that should be good enough.   2 Answers"

I interviewed at Google (New York, NY) in September 2017.","4 weeks since first contact from recruiter till offer.Started by a phone screen where you are expected to code in google doc. Suggestion to google: please consider building a code editor or use a third party tool like most other sane companies. The problème with google doc is that it tends auto-correct and auto format as though the code were “natural language”, which it is not. And that usually lead to a lot of time being wasted on fuzzing around .Then after two days, my recruiter said they wanted to bring me on site (NYC)On site included 5 technical interviews and a lunch “interview”. They insisted the lunch session was not an interview, but some other people I know told me otherwise.can’t get into details of the questions but here’s what I can say:- interview #1: standard graph traversal problem. Not as straightforward as “Do a BFS”, but some variations with some additional requirements . But you just need to identify the core problem. The rest is really just adds-on.- interview #2: lists manipulation. You are basically expected to come up with an algorithm . (It’s not as simple as applying some well known algorithm, but really invent a new one)- interview #3: tree traversals/variations : similar to #1 in that you just need to identify the key point, then it becomes easy.-interview #4: number theories. sort of hit-or-miss.. unless you are a mathematician who can come up with a solution on the flight or you have seen the problem before , I find it very hard to do this one .- interview #5: binary search variations. Not extremely hard. If you understand search/sort algorithms well, you can apply them to this problem .For all those questions, you are expected to be able to give time complexities of your solutions AND test cases (as comprehensive as possible). Also talk about any optimization if possible.One day after the on-site , I was told that the feedbacks looked good and that I was being submitted to hiring committee for decision, which would happen in 4 days (Tuesday)Around 3pm that day, i was so anxious that I decided to email my recruiter. (This is my second time interviewing at google and i typically didn’t reach out for update preemptively because I figured if they had news they would have shared it!) but this was an exception. She told me I was “cleared” for hire by the committee, and that they’d work on scheduling phone interviews with potential managers to find a team for me.Three phone calls were scheduled in the next two days and I was asked about my preference.A couple of days later I was told that they are moving forward with an executive review. Then after about three days (and a total of four weeks) I was officially presented with an offer.The salary negotiation was somewhat odd. They insisted on me providing an expected number first, but after I did, they gave me an offer with a base pay of about 30k short! When I contested they basically said the bonus and stock grants would bring the total to a lot more than what I had asked! (Which I found a little sneaky! Because when I named number, obviously I meant the base pay, not counting bonuses!) my recruiter seemed very anxious and wanted me to accept the offer within that day, which I told her I couldn’t . Then a couple of hours later they phoned me back and said they’d throw in an additional 20k cash bonus if i could accept it immediately.

Google,"Oct 24, 2016",No Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,I applied online. The process took 5 weeks. I interviewed at Google in October 2016.,"The interview started off great! The interviewer (who I will not name) started out by asking me what I'd been working on recently. I told him about one of my side projects (a Node.js based web app) that I found both interesting and worthy of note. He started asking me questions about my project, which was a useful exercise. Useful except for he never offered any sort of constructive criticism, and never gave any indication of whether my answers were good, or even acceptable. He also cut my train of thought off continuously, which was a theme of the entire interview. This is when I started feeling like the interview would probably not go so well.Once we moved past him asking questions about my side project, and him explaining several times he loves ""free styling"" the beginning portion of the interview, he moved onto asking me questions he had prepared. I don't remember the exact wording of his question, but it was essentially: ""create a function that grabs an HTML element, and, within a specific time period, change its color."" As it might be obvious, I had a few questions right from the get go. First of all, what is this specific time period? What do you mean ""change its color""? What color? I asked these, and more, questions, but it took some time to get a solid answer out of the interviewer. This was another theme throughout the interview. While attempting to solve the problem, I was trying my best to speak out my thought process (as per everything that gives advice for doing interviews), and noticed something. The interviewer seemed to always audibly set his phone down and turn it on speaker mode. I gave him the benefit of the doubt by assuming that he was typing down his interview notes. That being said, it was extremely distracting, and gave the impression that he wasn't paying attention to what I was saying. I mentioned before that he cut my train of thought off continuously, and this still holds true. Most often when I was asking questions, I would have a follow up question because he was being (perhaps purposefully?) vague. Whenever I asked the follow up question, I would almost immediately be cut off while he tried to describe something unrelated to my question, but related to the problem I was solving. Initially you might think that whatever he cut me off to say was important, but I can assure you, none of it was ever helpful.After about 15 minutes into the coding problem, the interviewer cut me off in the middle of me explaining my thought process to tell me that I now had access to two new helper functions. I know he did that because I was struggling a bit with one part of the problem, but he also kept telling me I didn't need to modify my original code in order to make use of these new functions... which I thought was strange. He also kept pointing out portions of my code that might not run correctly, and then when I would respond by trying to solve those problems, he would cut me off to say ""we don't need to worry about these"" and would tell me to move on. And without any warning after around 25 minutes into the problem, he said ""okay, we're done. Do you have any questions for me?""I asked him was ""do you like where you work?"" he responded with a very convoluted answer that was 90% him explaining he started his own company, and then interviewed with Google once (he really emphasised the ""once"") and got the job there. He didn't even give me an answer the first time I asked. It felt very much like he was tipping his nose up at me, and the word ""tool"" came to mind several times. After I finally got that answer out of him, he said ""alright, times up, nice talking to you, have a good one"" and hung up all of a sudden. I didn't even have time to say ""bye"" before he hung up.Overall, the coding problem portion felt extremely rushed (a problem that could have been easily remedied by not ""free styling"" the beginning of the interview), and was very confusing and frustrating due to the vagueness of the interviewer's answers to my questions, and constant unrelated comments on the interviewer's end. And the entire interview felt extremely unprofessional, and I couldn't help but think the interviewer had something else to do, or didn't want to interview in the first place. I wouldn't want to work with this person, let alone have him interview potential employees. He seemed self absorbed, wasn't good with his communication skills, and looked down on me. I'm okay with not being offered a job knowing that Google employs people like him."," Create a function that grabs an HTML element, and, within a specific time period, change its color.   Answer Question"

Google,"Sep 9, 2016",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 6 weeks. I interviewed at Google (Mountain View, CA) in July 2016.","I was contacted by a recruiter last year and had a series of initial conversations about my areas of interest and what opportunities were available at Google. In my particular case, Google waived the phone screen, and I was able to come directly onsite. I don't know if this is a common occurrence or not. A good chunk of my professional network is employed at Google - so I suspect that having some number of internal referrals may have helped. This is complete conjecture on my part though. I came to one of the campuses in Mountain View in July 2016 for my onsite interview.Initially, I had 5 interviews onsite. 4 of the interviews were coding sessions, and 1 interview was a system design question. The coding questions were challenging (one of them in particular I found to be quite difficult). The interviewers were good about making the sessions interactive and asking questions to help guide my thinking. While I cannot share specific questions - reviewing CS fundamentals (algorithms and data structures) will be helpful. The questions were similar to other ones I had been asked by other similar companies I was interviewing with or that I had come across online while studying. They're not quite the same but are similar in terms of topics covered and difficulty.In all of the interviews, interviewers asked how I could optimize my solution to scale for extreme cases. They didn't necessarily want to see me code a solution that could scale to large traffic volume or lots of data, but they wanted to see if I had an idea on what I could change or improve to optimize what I had written. Make sure you're comfortable evaluating the time and space complexity of your code.The interviewers were very cordial and were happy to answer any questions I had about what it was like to work at Google.About a week and a half after my onsite interview, the recruiter had indicated that I had done well enough to move forward in the process. The next step was to match to a particular team. I spent about 2 weeks speaking with various hiring managers and technical leads before finding a team where we mutually felt that I would be a good fit for the team.After I matched, my packet was then reviewed by an executive (an SVP of engineering). In my particular case, the SVP requested that I come in for one more additional system design interview. I'm not sure if this is a common occurrence or not. Based on my research online and speaking with some of my friends who work at Google, this usually isn't typical.I came back to Mountain View one more time for a one hour system design interview. After the interview, I was informed by the recruiter a few days later that based on my performance in the final interview that the SVP had approved my offer, and I accepted shortly afterwards.In terms of time frame, the process was roughly 6 weeks from when I had my initial onsite interview to when I was extended an offer. In comparison to some of the other large companies I was interviewing with at the time, this was better than average in terms of latency (many of the other companies took longer to turn around a decision).Overall, the process was pleasant. The recruiters who I worked with were extremely professional and very timely in their communication. They kept me in the loop constantly and responded to questions quickly. The engineers I spoke with onsite were all very nice and professional.",NDA   Answer Question

I interviewed at Google (Boulder, CO) in September 2016.","I was reached out to by a recruiter. I talked to him on the phone, and he asked a couple of technical questions, and then it went to a technical phone interview. There I wrote a program in python on a google doc, and was asked to come visit. I couldn't make it at the time and I called off the on-site interview. Fast forward a year and a half, and I was contacted again by a recruiter. I was more ready to see what Google had to offer, and asked to come out to visit their office in Boulder. I was super excited! What an opportunity!So, after a few weeks I went out there at my scheduled time. There are five mini-interviews and a lunch. Each mini-interview is a programming challenge, each one was like a homework assignment from a year 1 or 2 comp-sci class. Of course, the interviewer knows the questions and how to ask break the answer I came up with. But, overall it was kind of fun.Where it really broke down for me though was that there was no real making a connection with the interviewer. I am gainfully employed and I was really there to see if I could work with these guys, if it was worth the risk of starting a new job for the benefit of getting to work for a world-class software company. And the answer turned out to be no. I couldn't get a handle on the emotions of any of my interviewers at all. Everything they said sounded like it came from a script. Which I guess would be okay, but the worst part was the lunch.They paired me up with a random dude from the office, and I just could not connect. I asked about what he did, and got a single sentence about financial transactions. I asked about a generally geeky topic, and was told that ""I'm sure that we should be using this time to talk about Google, and not <geeky topic>."" Shocked at this, I said that I really wanted to know about who I was going to be working with, and asked what he was passionate about. I swear that he recited his college admission essay, and threw out a bunch of techno-babble that I'm sure was to impress me. Then I was shuttled back to the little conference room. I don't think I could even tell you what I felt right then, but I didn't feel very welcome or excited anymore.What I think this process taught me, is that I was supposed to be very impressed about Google as a brand. I wanted so bad to fit in, but I realized that it just wasn't for me. As I really looked hard at where I actually was, I saw that behind the velociraptor statue was a cubicle wall. It was just an office, like any other. The last 3 interviews in the afternoon, I may have self-sabotaged.I just didn't care anymore. I asked the interviewers what projects they worked on, and I got the same lack of passion I got from my lunch-mate. On the last interview I wasn't even writing code anymore, just some set notation and lambda functions to map over them. It was totally self serving, and I'm not convinced that the interviewer cared to follow along.I got a phone call about a week latter, to let me know that I had been passed up. Which was really nice to get. If I can say one thing about this process, it was very pleasant. I was so relived to hear that I had not been given an offer. If I had been, it would have been devastating to have to turn it down.A positive note, is that I did see people eating together during lunch, no one was alone. Which tells me that people do get along there. I'm sure it's not as bad as I perceived it to be.",NAN

I interviewed at Google (Mountain View, CA) in August 2016.","I was contacted by a recruiter that saw my resume from a previous application and liked it. He requested an updated resume and some transcripts and then scheduled a phone meeting to talk to me. After we spoke, we set up an online coding test (language of my choice) for me to take to see if I was even worth their time. It was 2 questions in 60 minutes. It was pretty challenging, giving the time constraint. I finished the first one, but did not have time to fully debug the second. I thought I blew it, but received a call that they wished to move forward with me. There was also a brief personality quiz I had to take. It was pretty standard HR stuff.After this, there were two phone interviews. Each one was with a Google engineer. A google doc was opened and I had to write code for 45 minutes on the spot. Talk through your responses with them. They want to see that you know how to think. After this, I was flown out to California for the onsite interviews.There were 4 interviews and a lunch with an engineer. They ask you questions and you code on a whiteboard. The interviewers don't seem very interested in you as a person and there is not a lot of personality here. They are simply grilling you on coding ability. My first three interviews went great. I solved the problems and had time to optimize them. On the last interview, my interviewer was 8 minutes late. He did not speak great English, and seemed eager to be finished with me. He let me misunderstand the problem and go in the wrong direction for 20 minutes before saying something. I had to start over and manged to just get the main parts of my code down (still uncompilable) before time ran out. I am quite sure this interview is what ruined my chances.I received a call about a week later that they did not want to move forward with me as a software engineer, but as I was still a good candidate, they wanted to consider me for their residency program. The program is similar to a post-graduate internship, where they give you 3 months of classroom learning and 9 months of project work, then evaluate you again after to see if they want to hire you.

Google,"Aug 22, 2016",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 2+ months. I interviewed at Google (Mountain View, CA) in July 2016.","Emailed recruiter (June 19) I had when I applied last year, asking to apply again. On June 30th I was contacted to schedule a phone screen for July 7th. Then we scheduled a phone interview for July 12th. Phone interview began with solving a fairly straightforward technical problem. Then after coding it on google docs, we talked about how to solve the problem so that it is scalable. This went really well, so I was called the next day and invited to come on-site.On-site (July 27th) consisted of 5 interviews:Interview 1:-Straightforward tree problem, solved without much of a hitch.-Extend same problem to work for a forest of DAGs. Had to rewrite the entire code but this was actually easier.-Discussed a third, more difficult problem. It was very similar to a problem I had already seen before, which I told him, but we continued, and I gave him the solution after a bit of remembering.Interview 2:-Straightforward array-of-objects question, went smoothly. Did a little bit of optimization that made it use constant memory in some instances.-Float array problem which I told him I had seen before. He said let's move on but I told him I had an answer which I thought was better than the more obvious solution. I told him it, and he said he'd never seen that solution before and agreed it was better for many instances.-Complex int array question. Was stumped for a while on this, needed some help. Eventually got a solution in O(n^2), then the day after when I was thinking about it I figured out a O(nlogn) solution, so mine was suboptimal.Interview 3:-Int array question, told him I'd seen it before, but he said that was ok. Solved without issue-Tree question, solved with a little bit of help. A little messy and suboptimal, I came up with a much cleaner solution after the interview.-System design-y question. I had about 3 minutes left. Told him my thoughts, he said it was in ""the right direction"", but I dunno.Interview 4:-Int array question, blurted out a solution immediately (which I kind of regretted), but he said, ok then code it, which I did without a problem. After coding it, he asked how to make it faster. I thought about it, and got the optimal solution without help but he didn't want me to code it.-String array question, again gave brute-force solution, then coded it. However, I had a LOT of trouble getting better than brute-force. Maybe 5-10 minutes of not getting anywhere (At least it felt like it).Interview 5:-Talked very briefly about a project I did last Summer. Seemed like she wanted to get past it ASAP.-She asked two questions, both of which I had seen before, which I told her. I rattled off the solution for both and she didn't ask me to code them. First question was a string/palindrome question. Second was a question about a series of lightbulbs.-Third question was an extension of the first, which I solved, but needed a little guidance at the end. She seemed happy with my use of StringBuilder.3 business days after the interview (Wednesday), I was told by my recruiter that she got the feedback from 3 of the 5 interviewers and they were ""very positive"". That Friday I was told the hiring committee had recommended me for hire. The following Friday (what a nerve-wracking week) I was given an official offer. (August 12)Advice: BUY ""CRACKING THE CODING INTERVIEW"". I went through the entire book, cover to cover (skipping programming-language specific chapters and the databases chapter, as well as the ""hard"" chapter) and wrote solutions down on paper. About a month before my interview, I started writing solutions down on a whiteboard, and began talking about the problems out loud while doing them. I HIGHLY recommend this.About 2 weeks before the interview, I studied the problems on careercup.com, which I thought was very influential to my success. If you do this, it is ESSENTIAL that you tell the person interviewing you when you are given a problem you've seen before. If you don't, they may see how quickly you solve it, and this could hurt your interview rather than help it. Also, telling them gets you honesty points, which can help. Four of the questions I was asked I had seen before exactly.Finally, don't give up! Two years ago, I tried to get an internship. The phone interviews went terribly. The next year, I got on-site, but the interviews only went ok, and got rejected. This year, I prepared for months, and it really does pay off.

Then I was asked to analyze performance and try to optimize my solution (or in some cases scale it up). Finally, I had to implement a solution on the white board. Some interviewers asked me to implement the brute-force first, before discussing possible optimizations. Others wanted me to optimize the solution first, and then implement one of the versions at the end (they didn't care which version I pick to implement, just wanted to see I can code). If there was time left, we discussed another more challenging open-ended problem (on a high level, just to see how I think), or had time for me to ask questions.

I interviewed at Google (Boulder, CO) in November 2013.","I was contacted by a recruiter. We decided that Boulder in the Google Docs group would be the best fit for my interests and background. The phone interview was fine, although I thought the interviewer was a little bit snarky when I responded to his question on how to improve Docs. I had an onsite interview with 5 different sets of people. A couple of the people were very nice, but I found the others to be rather socially inept. It is a tech company, so I expect this to some extent, but their interview process needs to take this into consideration. Only one person asked a question even remotely related to my work (about decision making and rationality I believe), and he had his set of opinions about it so didn't seem to like what I said. The coding interviews were all very similar- pretty contrived problems designed to test only one's coding knowledge. I went into the interviews believing that they appreciated creative solutions, but realized that if your solution is not one of the handful that they are familiar with, then they are unable to recognize the solution as viable. (Perhaps this is also partly my own fault if I didn't clearly express my idea), but a couple of them seemed very doubtful of anything I came up with. Also, communication problems were an issue. One interviewer asked me to generate a random number. I asked ""from scratch""? and he said yes. I thought about that one for a while and said I was stumped, not knowing the mathematics behind creating a pseudo random number. When I said that he was annoyed and went on to explain how to call rand(). At this point he was not interested in hearing what I had to say as an explanation or in my defense. The last interviewer shooed me out the door without asking if I needed to use the restroom, or if I had any questions. I note that I am female and the interviewers were all male. Some of the behavior may have been due to bias, or perhaps those people were simply biased against anyone new! There were very few women at that office though, 7 out of 200 engineers or something like that. Hopefully things have improved since then, but at that point I decided that Google was not a good fit and that I likely would not interview with them again.",Lots of questions about manipulating strings and sets of strings.   Answer Question

I interviewed at Google (Irvine, CA) in November 2016.","Recruiter contacted me a year and a half after being turned down for an internship position. I completed the online application and was told that I would receive two links via email: a coding sample and a short survey. The coding sample consisted of 2 simple programming problems that I was required to complete within an hour but in any programming language of my choice. One problem was significantly easier than the other; both were related to string processing. I completed both with 10 minutes to spare. The short survey took very little time and asked for basic background information.After completing both the sample and the survey, my recruiter followed up with a phone call to schedule me for a phone interview with a Google employee. The interview consisted of a single programming problem that was deceptively simple. My interviewer was a software engineer himself, and since I was able to finish the problem early, we chatted a little bit afterwards regarding life at Google.After passing the phone interview, I was handed over to a different recruiter who scheduled me for an on-site interview at my local Google offices. The on-site interview was a 5-6 hour process consisting of 2 technical interviews, lunch with a Google employee, and another 2 technical interviews afterwards. Interview questions ranged from programming problems to general computer science knowledge. In terms of interviewers, I felt like I got a mixed bag, but my experience was mostly positive. I was able to complete every single problem presented to me, though some of them came down to the very last minute. During lunch, I had the opportunity to tour the office, which was a pleasure in and of itself.About a week later, I received a call from my recruiter telling me that the hiring committee had turned me down.Overall, I was impressed with how straightforward and clear the entire interview process was.

On June 30th I was contacted to schedule a phone screen for July 7th. Then we scheduled a phone interview for July 12th. Phone interview began with solving a fairly straightforward technical problem. Then after coding it on google docs, we talked about how to solve the problem so that it is scalable. This went really well, so I was called the next day and invited to come on-site.On-site (July 27th) consisted of 5 interviews:Interview 1:-Straightforward tree problem, solved without much of a hitch.-Extend same problem to work for a forest of DAGs. Had to rewrite the entire code but this was actually easier.-Discussed a third, more difficult problem. It was very similar to a problem I had already seen before, which I told him, but we continued, and I gave him the solution after a bit of remembering.Interview 2:-Straightforward array-of-objects question, went smoothly. Did a little bit of optimization that made it use constant memory in some instances.-Float array problem which I told him I had seen before. He said let's move on but I told him I had an answer which I thought was better than the more obvious solution. I told him it, and he said he'd never seen that solution before and agreed it was better for many instances.-Complex int array question. Was stumped for a while on this, needed some help. Eventually got a solution in O(n^2), then the day after when I was thinking about it I figured out a O(nlogn) solution, so mine was suboptimal.Interview 3:-Int array question, told him I'd seen it before, but he said that was ok. Solved without issue-Tree question, solved with a little bit of help. A little messy and suboptimal, I came up with a much cleaner solution after the interview.-System design-y question. I had about 3 minutes left. Told him my thoughts, he said it was in ""the right direction"", but I dunno.Interview 4:-Int array question, blurted out a solution immediately (which I kind of regretted), but he said, ok then code it, which I did without a problem. After coding it, he asked how to make it faster. I thought about it, and got the optimal solution without help but he didn't want me to code it.-String array question, again gave brute-force solution, then coded it. However, I had a LOT of trouble getting better than brute-force. Maybe 5-10 minutes of not getting anywhere (At least it felt like it).Interview 5:-Talked very briefly about a project I did last Summer. Seemed like she wanted to get past it ASAP.-She asked two questions, both of which I had seen before, which I told her. I rattled off the solution for both and she didn't ask me to code them. First question was a string/palindrome question. Second was a question about a series of lightbulbs.-Third question was an extension of the first, which I solved, but needed a little guidance at the end. She seemed happy with my use of StringBuilder.3 business days after the interview (Wednesday), I was told by my recruiter that she got the feedback from 3 of the 5 interviewers and they were ""very positive"". That Friday I was told the hiring committee had recommended me for hire. The following Friday (what a nerve-wracking week) I was given an official offer. (August 12)Advice: BUY ""CRACKING THE CODING INTERVIEW"". I went through the entire book, cover to cover (skipping programming-language specific chapters and the databases chapter, as well as the ""hard"" chapter) and wrote solutions down on paper. About a month before my interview, I started writing solutions down on a whiteboard, and began talking about the problems out loud while doing them. I HIGHLY recommend this.About 2 weeks before the interview, I studied the problems on careercup.com, which I thought was very influential to my success. If you do this, it is ESSENTIAL that you tell the person interviewing you when you are given a problem you've seen before. If you don't, they may see how quickly you solve it, and this could hurt your interview rather than help it. Also, telling them gets you honesty points, which can help. Four of the questions I was asked I had seen before exactly.Finally, don't give up! Two years ago, I tried to get an internship. The phone interviews went terribly. The next year, I got on-site, but the interviews only went ok, and got rejected. This year, I prepared for months, and it really does pay off. Even if your previous interviews were not so good."," NDA makes me paranoid. I don't think the questions are technically confidential, though.   1 Answer"

After the lunch my room was changed. It was a small room with a really really small whiteboard. I guess it was around 30inch width. It was really hard to code on such a small interview. It was hard to put clean code on such a small board. I had to clean parts that I wrote earlier to fit in everything. One of the interviewer was so ignorant, he was not paying attention to interview.

Was then invited to an on-site interview in Mountain View, where I had four hour-long interviews and an hour-long lunch with a google employee.There were a couple issues I had with the process.1) The initial recruiter somehow determined I had a year of professional experience in Android development, which was not true. Therefore, she initially put me on the hiring track for someone who had professional Android experience rather than the hiring track for a recent college graduate. I passed the phone interview on this track, but then the next recruiter I spoke with discovered the error and switched me over to the recent college graduate track for the in-person interview.2) My recruiter never showed up in the lobby to pick me up for the in-person interview, so 20 minutes after the interview was supposed to start my first interviewer called to find out where I was. She requested that I come to the building where she was, but the secretary said I wasn't allowed to walk there by myself and that she had to come pick me up. I had to tell her to come pick me up, then we went back to the building and started the interview quite late.

I interviewed at Google (Mountain View, CA) in April 2017.","All of the big companies in Silicon Valley use a similar style of interview. It's well known and Google lays it all out for you. The rest is mostly up to you. My interview seemed to go well overall but there were a couple specific things that made it a bit of a negative experience.For me, the interview was five 45 minute sessions, plus lunch in the middle. All were technical interviews with engineers – no cultural fit interviews.Some of the sessions were typical white boarding sessions. And most of the questions seemed relevant. But one session in particular focused on a problem that I felt bordered on being more of a brainteaser than an indicator of actual real world performance. Don't get caught off guard. Make sure that you don't just understand all of the major review topics, but can also implement them without much thought, no matter how academic they might seem.The other sessions were design/architecture discussions, which I really enjoyed. Although, I felt a little blindsided in one of them. That interview started with a description of a feature and I was asked how I might implement it, in general terms. As the conversation progressed, we got into some white boarding about the data model and talked about performance. So far, so good, I thought. But just five or ten minutes before the end, the interviewer said that she needed to see some code before our time was up. Code?! Needed?! Based on how the interviewer had led the conversation up until then, I had no idea that was an expectation. In other architecture sessions I did that day, coding wasn't a concern at all. So maybe it's worth confirming early what an interviewer wants by the end.On a side note, I also felt that there was a bit of a language barrier between me and two of the interviewers.

I was taken back at the question as I wasnt expecting anything of that sort but managed to explain a coding issue i faced in my work project.And after that he gave me a vague coding question and I had to ask lot of questions back to figure out what he really wants me to do and how the input is given and what should I return (this itself took lot of time). There were hardly any hints and he kept saying yes for everything I told.. nothing like its right or wrong. I explained the solution to him but couldnt finish coding all of it as he ended the interview exact to the min although we started late.

Google,"Apr 20, 2018",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"I applied through an employee referral. The process took 2 weeks. I interviewed at Google (Mountain View, CA) in April 2018.","Google is where talented software engineers go to die.I don't think Google is wrong for everybody, but I do suspect it's wrong for most people who aspire to work there.My interview process with Google consisted solely of onsite interviews, as I was able to skip the phone screens due to an employee referral from my friend. Out of the several onsite interviews I did this interview cycle, Google's was by far the least inspiring. I have prior work experience at a similar big-name, big-size, big-money tech company, and that experience wasn't for me. I didn't particularly expect Google to be different, but I still walked away feeling very disappointed with the experience.The interviews consisted of very raw algorithms questions. There was virtually zero collaboration, so each interview was essentially me standing at a whiteboard, talking to a wall about what I was doing. At the end I might get some followup questions. Even if conversation and collaboration were emphasized in Google's interview process, I'm not confident the interviewers would have been capable of it. Either though social awkwardness or language barriers, communication would have been near impossible at the level needed for technical collaboration.Not a single interviewer asked me about myself or my background, or seemed to take any interest in all in me beyond how well I could write code on a whiteboard. This is a huge red flag for someone looking to love their place of work - you have no expectations about your future coworkers other than the fact that they can produce well-written algorithms on a whiteboard when asked. Google's culture is defined by existing on the forefront of technology, so the only real requirement is your ability to work there. Just don't expect to like your coworkers.In terms of difficulty, the interviewers were average, leaning towards harder. I definitely had harder interviews elsewhere, and felt that Google's reputation for being brutal was a bit over-stated. This might be a product of Google's current aggressive hiring efforts, however.I went through team-matching with Google, and encountered one team in particular who was very excited about me joining, stating my background and skillset is perfect for what they're looking for. Unfortunately, while any other company would recognize that as strong enough of a factor to move forward, I did not receive an offer. My feedback was something along the lines of my whiteboard code has some bugs in it. Oh, and they also asked for my college transcript... I graduated in 2015. They were the only company out of the 15 or so I interviewed with that asked for that.I feel that Google helped pioneer the technical interview process, and once served as a bastion for what it means for a company to have a strong culture and be a joyful place to work. Unfortunately, I do not think Google has maintained that status, and instead have fallen significantly behind as other companies have moved ahead.I hope that my experience can serve to help broaden the perspective of people like the younger version of myself - fresh out of college with the impression that Google is the dream. If you care about individual impact, entrepreneurship, collaboration, a constructive culture with kind coworkers, or significant career advancement opportunities, Google is probably not for you. If you want a high-pay, high-stability job where you can focus on your code and support your family, Google might be worth considering.

A recruiter reached out to me on Linkedin in Seattle while I was at another position. We met on the Google campus, but I wasn't ready for a change. 3 or 4 months later he offered me materials to help prepare for interviewing, should I be interested. Fast forward 1 year: I applied for a different role in Boulder, CO and decided it wasn't for me. The recruiter in Seattle noticed this and - outside of his responsibilities - called me out of the blue to see if there was anything else in Boulder that might interest me. He then handed me off to another recruiter in Boulder, who must be the nicest and most supportive recruiters I've ever met. Amazingly fast, Google brought me onsite with 4 days notice to keep pace with other interviews. I interviewed onsite and was informed of an offer ~2.5 weeks later. Bringing me onsite with such short notice - and skipping the phone screen because of my prior experience - was a huge benefit.The very small negatives: Like any Googler will tell you, the process is glacially slow.

Phone screen: the first interviewer never called, which was unfortunate, but the recruiters (plural) were happy to re-schedule whenever I was ready (I say ""recruiters"" because it is common that you email your recruiter, they are away for the day, and your messages is auto-directed to another recruiter. I think I had contact with four different people on the recruiting team during my experience).The phone screen went well. There was about 10 minutes of soft talk, a technical coding problem (leetcode medium in difficulty, but with simpler constraints for the sake of the phone screen), and then a follow-up system design problem (because I have some working experience).2. On-sites:Five interviews. The first four were data structures/algorithms/""coding."" The first interview was somewhat soft, wherein they spent 12.5 minutes on soft questions, another 12.5 minutes on abstract technical questions (e.g.: what sort of trade-off exists between two different algorithms to solve a simple problem), and then 20 minutes on a coding question. The coding question was very simple (a string processing question)The next three interviews were sort of insane. They were very challenging questions. One was a leetcode hard dynamic programming question taken straight off the site. The next was a very confusing tree question. The one after that was a unique dynamic programming question. They were all very challenging, but, I likely should have been better-prepared.The final interview was system design.

Google,"May 31, 2018",No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,I applied through an employee referral. I interviewed at Google.,"I interviewed May 2018.The interview process was reasonably straight forward - two phone screens that asked purely technical questions. These were not particularly difficult; however explaining your solution and thought process over the phone was somewhat taxing. I am reasonably sure that my first interviewer didn't quite understand what I was thinking, hence the need for the 2nd phone screen. At this point, I was transferred to a different recruiter for my onsite evaluation.After passing the 2nd phone screen, I was flown out the Mountain View for an onsite interview. I signed up for the interview prep session, held every Friday. The recruiter informed me that it would be a mock interview style class, however the presented repeated lots of information given to me from the recruiter, or what you could find online. There was one technical problem given to us, then students volunteered and told the class their solution - this was no reflection of coding on the whiteboard interview style. Honestly, this was probably a waste of time.The onsite interview was 5 rounds plus lunch. Each round was exactly the same, 2-3 technical questions with a solution that could be coded on the whiteboard. I didn't find any of the questions particularly challenging, they were probably leetcode medium level questions and definitely shorter than most coding questions online. Some of the interviewers were easy to work with - it seemed like there was a correlation between how long they were at the company and how smooth the interview went. One guy was clearly sick and would awkwardly laugh throughout the interview. He left without any salutation and didn't ask any personal questions. Another interviewer had less than two years experience, he had two questions prepared one of which was already asked during my phone screen... (hmmm nice planning google) I told him that and he was clearly thrown off. The last interviewer was unfamiliar with my requested coding language (python) and didn't understand lots of the built in methods that were being used.The recruiter called me back a couple days later and told me my interview was ""borderline"" and we would not proceed in the hiring process. She mentioned that I was not receptive of the feedback during the interviews; however I got all the technical questions correct. When I requested more interviews, she checked with someone and replied that they wouldn't help my application. My best guess is she was lying through her teeth - if my interview was truly ""borderline"". Also, the recruiter would never send me this information in writing in an email, she would send an email and ask to call me. This was both inconvenient and sketchy, its almost as if they didn't want to have a paper trail. I'm not certain, but there may have been some kind of hidden agenda. If they didn't like how I behaved, why would they encourage me to apply again? When I asked if I could leave my feedback on the interview process, my recruiter told me that I would be able to fill out a survey that would be sent to me in an email. Its been a month and I still haven't received this email.Overall, I was dissatisfied with the process. Although there was excellent communication, I think there could have been a bit more transparency and planning on their end. I get it, Google is big and HR is huge and is going through growing pains, but I was sketched out by some of their shady tactics and poor planning. If google was really looking for top candidates, they could spend a little more time evaluating candidates instead of telling them to simply 'reapply in 6-12 months'. Unfortunately, the flipside of this is that its tiring for candidates to prepare and complete the interviewing process. If you interview 3-4 times and still don't get the job, you probably aren't cut out for Google, but I've heard of multiple instances where very qualified candidates need to interview multiple times before getting an offer. The process produces waste and false negatives, but seems to work for them.Also, if you are driving to the Mountain View campus, be wary of parking. I spent upwards of 30 minutes after getting off 237 to find parking. This is really bad traffic at the freeway exit and the roads near google. I ended up parking down the street at Microsoft and running to make my 10am interview. Interviewer beware!!"," The questions were straight forward with minimal to no tricks. Practice makes perfect, understand DS and algorithms. Then practice until you start visiting different websites and seeing the same problems. Cracking the code + appendix covers most everything, then its up to you to apply those techniques in real problems. Most of my problems were with tries, practicing with tries really helped complete all the problems. Same formula over and over, get problem, match relevant data structure(s), then create one or more loops to populate the data structure(s). Possibly, do some sort of analysis at the end to product the final answer.At the same time, find a language that you are comfortable with and master it, know all the built in functions. If you are at the point where you don't need to look up built in functions, then you are ready.   Answer Question"

You need to find a way out to make them stop confusing you and give them a correct answer.

Initial contact by an Alumni Specialist, as I had previously interned but have a year of industry experience. The specialist determined my project interests and location preference and then connected me with an appropriate recruiter (in London). Skipped over the initial tech screen and went straight to an onsite, with an option of interviewing in Seattle (where I was living) or flying to London. I opted for interviewing locally, as I didn't want jet lag to negatively affect my performance. I scheduled it about a month later to allow time to prepare.A standard day of interviews from 10am to 4pm, 2 coding/algorithms in the morning, 1 non-tech lunch interview in which I got paired up with a friend of mine from college who works at Google (no feedback is written for this round), then 3 coding/algorithms in the afternoon.After the onsite interview, it took about a week to get feedback, which was positive so I moved into team matching (prior to hiring committee, which is apparently the newest policy).

We talked about where I was and what I was looking for. After that my recruiter scheduled a phone screening.Phone Screening:I scheduled the screening a few weeks out to give me time to prepare. The screening was a phone call with an engineer in New York where I coded on a Google Doc. He asked me two questions in about 50 minutes which I answered pretty quickly and then I asked about his work. Less than 12 hours later I was emailed saying that I had positive results and would be moving on to the on-site interviews.Onsite:This is also something I scheduled a few weeks out. I was flown in from out of state and stayed near their campus. The interview itself was 5 x 45minute sessions. 3 in the morning, lunch and then 2 in the afternoon. The questions are what you would expect from any of the coding question websites. Except for my last question which was unlike anything I've ever seen before in my life. I felt overall the interviews went well but not exceptional. From what I gathered online, they need to go exceptional so I expected I would be turned down.Results:5 days later my recruiter gave me a call and told me I missed the bar by a small margin. She told me for my first time going onsite I had very high scores and to not feel bad as most engineers go through the process a few times before making it.

Google,"Jun 22, 2018",No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,I applied through a recruiter. The process took a week. I interviewed at Google in June 2018.,"I was contacted by the recruiter, who scheduled a technical phone screening to take place the following week. The recruiter emailed me some materials, mostly links to videos and websites, which she suggested I look over. I felt very comfortable before the phone interview because I regularly solve coding problems and interview questions on sites like hackerrank, leetcode, and codewars. I also spent about 4 hours each day preparing for the interview during the last few days. I was expecting the interview question to be moderately difficult with multiple steps; I was surprised at how particularly specific and trivial the question was. The interviewer worded the question in an obscure way and it took me several minutes and several questions to figure out what exactly was being asked. I answered the question correctly, talked about the performance implications as well as some edge cases. The interview concluded and after about two days the recruiter contacted me to tell me the interviewer did not feel that I was qualified to move forward in the process and I was eliminated. The part I found most frustrating is that while I believe I'm a strong enough candidate to warrant a real interview, I was turned down after a single phone screen question that I answered correctly. Worse still, apparently the recruiter informed me I cannot reapply to Google for a year.I don't understand why I was rejected after answering a poorly constructed question correctly.

Google,"Oct 22, 2018",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 2+ months. I interviewed at Google (Cambridge, MA) in September 2018.","(Google L3)Full write-up is below, but I want to start with the one *very strange* thing about the onsite interview that I have not found documented anywhere else on the internet:I was told by my recruiter that at least ONE of the my five onsite interview questions had to be done in C++.This should sound very strange to you--Google is well known on the internet to be language-agnostic for the interviews. And I think this is generally true. I asked all of my SWE friends about this, and they were also baffled. My recruiter insisted. I was doing my interviews in Python because the language is concise (no need to even think about closing brackets when whiteboarding, which is low-key really distracting).My C++ skills were *very* rusty, so I spent a full week before the onsite tearing through A Tour of C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup and leetcoding C++. This was a mistake. I should have started prepping C++ a week earlier because it's a language that takes time to master (there are lot of little details). The feeling that I hadn't crammed enough C++ for the onsite definitely hurt my confidence, but my recruiter told me I could pick any of my interviews to do in C++, I had some flexibility to be strategic.In the end, none of my interviewers seemed to be aware of this C++ interview requirement (lol). I ended up doing poorly on the question i chose to do in C++ because I ended up using some data structures to solve the problem that I didn't anticipate in my preliminary analysis (lol). But I verbalized all of my main ideas (which were correct) to my interviewer, so I'm sure I got partial credit. I have a feeling I could have just ignored the C++ requirement and no one would have noticed.I also ended up bombing one of the questions I did in Python (lol). Surprisingly, I was called a week later notifying me that I passed the hiring committee (I thought the C++ slip-up might have killed me!). I ended up matching with a team that primarily uses to C++, and I took the offer. So I guess it's good I guess the prep paid off in the end. Big fat lol.======= full write-up:My interview experience was excellent. My recruiters really did a great job of keeping me in the loop and making sure my schedule and travel were squared away. I applied the Cambridge office cos I wanted to get out of the Bay.Graduated with a B.S. in CS in 2017 from a top 5 US college (but not top 10 for CS). No prior experience working at large tech companies of any kind, but had been working at a startup in SF since graduating.I was contacted by a recruiter on linkedin in early 2018 about applying. I quit my job a few months later to prep for interviews full time. This strategy worked for me (and I *would* do it again), but YMMV so be aware of the risks!!!! My previous employer graciously offered me part-time hourly work, which was very convenient for this.I had several glowing internal referrals submitted by former coworkers and friends vouching for my skills and character.The technical phone screen I would say was leetcode easy/medium, but YMMV. I was lucky that my TPS was so easy, cos I needed way more prep to pass an actual onsite :PI asked for (and received) 5 weeks to prep for the onsite. I did one onsite at another company just a few days before google's. I wish I had done a couple more onsites to boost my confidence (I ended up failing my first onsite), but oh well it all worked out in the end.The interview was typical leetcode medium, with sometimes leetcode hard follow-ups. All on a whiteboard. 5 technical interviews with one informal lunch interview at the cafe with an engineer.

Google,"Nov 27, 2010",No Offer,Neutral Experience,Easy Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 1 day. I interviewed at Google (Palo Alto, CA) in August 2010.","Google recruiter picked my Linkedin profile and contacted me. Initial phone conversation with her was followed by the first phone interview with a manager (each manager I talked to stressed he was totally hands-on, just like other developers, plus carried managerial responsibilities). I'd say this was probably true based on the types of questions he asked. He mostly asked me about my current and past jobs, projects, accomplishments, approaches to design, team work, etc - pretty much ""traditional"" relaxed semi-technical interview questions. This one went extremely well, as per my recruiter's feedback.The next one also went well - now with the team lead for the group they wanted me for. A few design questions, one technology question (what do you think of using technology X for solving the problem Y?). Plus one pretty simple algorithm that I was asked to explain on the phone, although my recruiter initially told me about coding using Google's online collaborative tools. It was awkward to just ""talk"" through the algorithm, instead of writing and talking as I normally do.Finally, on-site interview. They said they would only have four people to interview me, plus the fifth one would take me for lunch and answer any off-record questions. Bummer - I thought there would be more people, meaning more challenges, but also more chances to show my skills. Four people seemed too few.Personal interviews turned into a problem right away.First, no one cared about my professional career and accomplishments. Took me off-guard - is it because they think it's irrelevant to Google? In any event, it's their way, so having figured out their style in the first half an hour I tried just to accept it and move on.The second problem turned out to be a killer: in most cases I totally misinterpreted the intent and scope of their questions, and I am still not quite sure if was my fault.One guy asked to sketch the design of some distributed system. I enumerated all the typical issues - distribution, scalability, database synchronization, etc and how to approach them. The guy kept asking more questions, but I thought he was not satisfied and had no clue why. Finally - after good half an hour, he said he basically just wanted me to write the algorithm, that would perform the core function of the entire system, which was computing some stats on the data collected in real-time by that very distributed system. All the challenges of distributed systems design turned out _not_ to be what he was after! Why not to scope the question clearly from the beginning? I gave the best shot at the algorithm, which was trivial, compared to the types of algorithms I do at work. By then I was slightly pissed off by what happened, so I got the right answer pretty slow by my own standards. It almost appeared as if I spent the whole interview trying to write one trivial algorithm!In that and some other questions, I should have basically ignored much of their content, focusing instead on identifying some core algorithm working on idealized data sets - while the way questions were stated would make you think that the core was designing distributed systems collecting such data!One week later recruiter told me they'd passed on me due to insufficient algorithmic skills - with the algorithms as simple as the ones asked, that was pretty ironic. I was told everyone liked me on all other accounts, and that the recruiter will contact me in 6 to 8 months to re-try the whole thing. I am not sure if I want to pursue it, but I might.Having known what I know now (not specific questions, but the expectations behind them), I would've, probably, passed that interview easily. The take-out lesson for me - they are into algorithms and little else, even for senior positions. When approaching their questions, try to start with some simple algorithm expressing the core idea, and ignore everything else - even if this ""everything else' constitutes the main challenge in real-life development! If you just write this algorithm down correctly, you score. If their question was more involved, they will probably tell you, but you'll score anyway.Regardless of whether I personally think that Google's interviewing practices are conducive to hiring the best people (I don't), it is their way, so you just have to accept it if you want to get in.",NAN

Google,"Feb 7, 2012",No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,"I applied online. The process took a week. I interviewed at Google (Mountain View, CA) in January 2012.","I was contacted by a Google recruiter to first schedule a phone interview.The phone interview was to be held on the phone and through Google docs where both the interviewer and I could type in text on the same page.When talking to the recruiter, she asked me what languages I was the strongest in. I responded that my most recent languages were C and Matlab. She said that the interview would be in one of these two languages, but that the potential on-site interview could be in anything on my resume. My most recent background is in embedded systems development, but to my complete surprise once the phone interview started, the interviewer asked questions in C++. I did answer the initial basic C++ question correctly, but I was not prepared to answer the C++ questions and I asked the interviewer if she was familiar with my background and if she could switch to C instead. She did.During the interview she asked about software implementation of the cache driver first. We had a detailed discussion about it. Then she asked if I was familiar with binary trees. I said that I have heard of them, but never used them, and explained that I have used linked lists in the past and implemented basic search functions on them. We later discussed differences between arrays and linked lists and I answered all her questions correctly. So, in total, of the questions she did ask, I answered all of them correctly and frankly did not find them very insightful or difficult.A week later, I received the call from the recruiter that I would not have any further interviews. Citing company policy, she declined to provide specifics. She did say that they were looking for people with broad backgrounds.Here is what I think happened.In short, the interviewer's background was completely different from mine. I would not have any issue with that, after all Google is a software company, but that is not how the process was explained to me. I was prepared for a completely different type of interview, based on the comments from the recruiter. Not only did the recruiter set me up for a different type of interview, the interviewer herself was completely not familiar with my background. There seem to be limited communication between the recruiter and the interviewer and little understanding of my qualifications on their behalf.I feel misled, because I should have not been told by the recruiter that the interview would be conducted in C, whereas clearly the interviewer must have had her eyes set on C++. I would have prepared for a C++ interview if it were not for the comments by the recruiter. For sure I would have not asked to switch to C, if I had any inclination that C++ were so important to them. The interviewer should have insisted on conducting the interview in C++, if it were so important. She should have insisted on my answering the binary tree questions, if they were so important.Lessons learned:1. Do not take everything the recruiter tells you as 100% accurate. Google is now a large company and has large company policies, meaning the recruiter may have very limited communication with the interviewer.2. Be prepared for any type of questions, regardless of your own background. It may not be checked.3. Be prepared for specific skill tests, not only for evaluation of your thinking ability. In spite of Google claiming that the interview process is about determining how candidates think, it is apparently not always true. I have IQ over 170. My logic in my answers was 100% accurate, but I did not want to discuss issues I was not prepared for. I do not think the interviewer was interested in my thought process or in my thinking capability. It appears that she was merely interested in me solving academic problems that she knew the answers to.",Desing a 4-way software cache driver.   4 Answers

I was contacted by a recruiter within 3 days (including the weekend) and set up an interview for 2 weeks from that date. It was two back to back technical phone interviews. The interviewers let you choose what language you wish to demonstrate your knowledge in. I chose Java for both.My first interviewer was great. He introduced himself and throughout the interview, was very proactive on trying to guide me through a difficult part of the problem or hinted if he wanted more to the solution. I had to constantly verbalize my thought process, as it was a phone interview, so he mainly responded to that.My second interviewer was not so great. He was 10 minutes late and seemed like he didn't want to help at all. Even after his ""explanation"" of the problem, including a confusion-inducing analogy, I was still a bit uncertain about the problem, so I just went with what I thought was right. It ended up being mostly correct until he literally started to yell at me over the phone for the last line, which was parsing an object to an int, then back to an object when there was another method that did what I was trying to do already (which he didn't explain, so I didn't know what it was, go figure).

I was contacted by HR, he asked me if I would like to give another try.During the phone screen with HR, I expressed my interested in the role that I am good at, (but I am not sure if he care about it or not), he transfer me info to another HR and schedule me to onsite directly. When I expressed my interest again, the 2nd HR said I will go through the general process to see if I could reach the average bar, not the specific team. (Hmm..ok, not as same as I did last time)On the onsite day, I arrived the campus 30 min earlier, but it is not helpful. The first interviewer came to pick me up 10 min late instead of HR. And she would like to bring me to the room to interview but she is totally lost in the campus...so we wasted 10~15min to find out the way to the room. Therefore the first interview was began in very hurry, even affect the start time of 2nd interview. The only good time during the interview is lunch time. (of course) The person who brought me to lunch was really nice and talkative, we chatted a lot about the life and culture in Google. However, the first interviewer after the lunch was late as well, even worse (20 min late)....The questions they asked are not difficult...those are general question. I basically answered all the questions, what I thought, trade off, etc. But every interview I got is in hurry...I don't think they were relaxing to have interview with me, they just want to finish their interview task in the limited time. And that also forced me to answer in hurry....After the whole day of onsite interview, I found every interviewer from the same team (there is no a person from the team I am interested in). I did not even see my HR on that day.2 weeks later, I followed up with HR, he said he still collect the feedback....and 2-3 days later, I got his email that the team thought I am not fit and decided not to move forward.First, I felt sad that I got this notification from email but not phone. and second, OF COURSE...the team who interviewed me are not match with my background, I thought they were just helping general interview process, but not the specific role (this was what HR said)....I was speechless...In comparison with the interview 2 years ago, I had a great time to have the whole interview process (phone, onsite), HR was really nice and host the onsite, and let me have interviews with the people from the team I am interested. Besides, the people I interviewed with were really professional and asked the correct questions about the certain field. After several days later (not in a week), I got the phone from HR that they decided not to move forward and wish me luck. Although I did not get the offer, I still would like to give a positive feedback for whole experience because they did really well and I felt respected from them.However, I felt really bad about this time.

Preferably: Javascript, Dart, Go, C, C++, Java, Python because these are the main languages used at Google.Practice leetcode: I personally did 27 easies, 35 mediums, 0 hard. Also, try to spread out the topics and cover them as much as possible: dynamic programming, tree traversals, graph traversals, hash tables, string manipulation, .etcThink of all the simple data structures and algorithms and rewrite them from scratch in your selected language. Code it out preferably on a Google Docs, then compile and run the program with your eyes or hands. Here are some of my suggestions:Data Structures: hash table, double ended queue, queue, stack, heap, unsorted array, sorted array, singly linked list, doubly linked list.Algorithms: Tree traversal, DFS (both iteratively and recursively), BFS, DFS and BFS on 2 most common graph representations, O(N^2) sorting algorithm, O(NlogN) sorting algorithms, O(N) non-comparision-based sorting algorithms, sorting stability.Also, keep in mind what Google is also looking for in a candidates:- General cognitive ability: are you able to analyze a problem, figure out the gaps in problem requirements. -> Ask clarifying questions to test your assumptions before jumping to conclusions.- Emerging Leadership ability: Are you willing to let go of power? You should have a discussion with your interviewers, and work out the problem with your interviewers as a team. And don't ever verbally fight with the interviewers.- Role-related knowledge: I think, given the prep above, it should cover it for DS/A, but certain candidates have system design interviews, so brush up on that topic as well.- Googleyness: Are you comfortable with ambiguity? How do you tackle the ambiguity in the interview? It's like a test of creativity. Also, are you willing to admit your mistake? Are you able to spot a mistake and fix it right in the interview? Are you able to change your perspective given new data? .etc",NAN

Google,"Mar 22, 2019",No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,I applied through a recruiter. The process took 6 weeks. I interviewed at Google.,"My phone interview was good, the interviewer is very friendly, the question was medium level. Some string manipulation. I solved it well and got an onsite interview.The onsite interview was a quite bad experience for me. Overall, I feel like they did not want me to be hired. They asked very tough questions. Either very difficult to implement, with lots of cases to consider, which is hard (and painful too) to finish writing everything in time, or very difficult to come up with a good algorithm to solve the problem, if you have never seen the problem then you are not going to come up with a good algorithm and finish writing code in time. I personally think it is stupid to ask questions like that, it does not reflect how well my coding skills are. It is testing how many leetcode questions you have solved, if you have seen those then you're lucky, otherwise you just don’t get the job.All of the four interviews are male and are from the same race, I do not see any diversity there and I do not want to work in an environment like that. Three of the interviewers were friendly, one was not, he refused to help me out at all, instead, he kept discouraging me, repeatedly telling me I was wrong, I explained, but he just kept pointing out things he doesn't understand and said they're wrong, which is super annoying and wasted lots of time. I wish I could finish my method and explain to him, and he could try to understand me, instead of being so hostile and trying to prove I'm wrong. What’s the point? I do not know why he was hired and how his co-workers can stand him. Guess that's the ones people call arrogant, they think they're the best since they work at Google, but that's not necessarily true. Sometimes you get easy interview questions and sometimes you get hard ones when you have bad luck.I feel like this company does not care about me, they don't care what I have done, none of them ever asked about my past projects or experience. I also feel that I was not welcomed as a woman engineer, I hope Google will work on that in the future. They don’t care how much I have prepared for the interview, they just give you one hard question and expect you to write perfect code to perfectly solve the problem. I felt like a complete idiot after the interview, it was so discouraging, it took me a while to get out and gain my confidence back and realize that they just did not see what I actually can do. My lesson from my interview experience is that you need to do a lot of leetcode questions, I did about 200 (and read two books), which is not enough apparently. You probably need like 500 to get a job at Google. I don’t know if that’s worth it, it’s up to you but I personally think this system is wrong. If you have no clue what career path to go, you just want to be an SDE at Google, then maybe it’s worth it, otherwise, working on projects in your field will be a better use of time in my opinion."," tree, graphs, dfs, recursion related questions   1 Answer"

Google,"Aug 26, 2014",No Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,I applied online. I interviewed at Google (Tel Aviv-Yafo (Israel)).,"I contacted Google through their website and applied for a software engineer in the Tel Aviv Office. There was an initial phone call with an HR recruiter (I think a day after I submitted my online application) - Just general questions about who I am and what I am looking for.After around 1 week I came to the on-site screening interview - 45 minutes of relatively simple graph questions - DFS/BFS stuff, and maybe a bit more complex questions regarding binary trees, but nothing too special. The interviewer told me I did well, but that I should be a bit more careful about the aesthetics of the code.2 weeks later I came to my whole day interview session - There were 6 interviews - I would say 3 which were more algorithmic, 1 which was almost pure coding, and 2 which were ""design"".The design interviews I remember -1) Design an online battlefield game - What would be the protocols between the server and the client, the algorithms and game flow to decide the state of the game, some basic networking (which I struggled with).2) How would you design Google images? The premise was that I should be able to search regarding specific features, for example the blue content, or images that are in pages that contain specific keywords. This was a very open-ended question, we thought ""together"" about solutions, what will be the size of my data which maps words to images, where would I store the images, how many servers I would need, etc... I had no previous experience in large scale design - The interviewer said that it wasn't expected of me. I thought I did relatively well, but I guess they ARE looking for people with previous experience in large scale design, from the input I got later on.Algorithmic interviews I remember -1) How would you design an efficient algorithm to find out in a sorted array which number appears the most times. I started from the simple solution, and continued to a more complex one ( with some hints along the way from the interviewer) that in summary does a binary search of the number of times the most frequent number appear - (think about it - I have an array of size N, if the most frequent number appears N/2 times, then I can infer this just from sampling the values at indexes (0,N/4,N/2,N*3/4,N). I thought I did well in that interview.2) Write code that prints the Cartesian product (row by row for each combination) of a given list of lists (that contain integers). Since you don't know from beforehand how many lists there are, you obviously can't just hard-code lots of for loops. During the interview I gave two solutions - A recursive one, and after writing it out, they asked me to also write a non-recursive one - Which I did with a counter which maps each times to a different combination of values (with some mod mathematics).I think I also did well in that interview.There was a lunch break where it was obvious they simply told someone that today ""you have to eat lunch with a candidate"". It was a bit awkward at first, but it did give me a chance to interrogate him about how it is to work in Google. The food was extra yummy.After one week I got a response that I didn't pass the interview process. The guy stressed that I was ""Close"", that I did really good on 2 interviews and a bit less good on the other 4. Oh well.My preparation to the interview consisted of doing all the regular algorithmic/coding questions - I think that did prepare me well to the relevant interviews. But there was no real preparation to the more general ""System Design"" interviews - I think it's a bit more difficult to prepare for those, but I guess I still would have invested in that more time, retrospectively. Otherwise - I thought I did pretty well in the interview day - I guess that they can be REALLY picky about taking people who really did perfect in each and every interview. Just for reference I had an interview day at Facebook a few days later - I thought I did much better at the Google interview day, but ended getting an offer from Facebook and not Google. I guess also some luck doesn't hurt.The responsive of the hiring recruiter was always prompt. He was very nice, though at times it was a bit ridiculous - telling me again and again to call him If I have any problems, even if it's during the weekend or late at night.

The intial technical screening seemed fair to me, starting with a moderate problem that can be solved in many ways, ensued by a more intricate problem where a couple of hints helped me to get it right. After a few days I got the positive answer from the recruiter and I was invited to the Google Zurich office for the on-site interview, which took place about a month later at my request. The on-site interview was tough, don't expect any less. Each of the 5 sessions started with a moderate question that can be solved with adequate training (e.g. LeetCode). And each of the sessions will become more difficult after solving the initial problem - the interviewer wants to see you reach your limits. Expect to be mentally drained when leaving the Google office. After two weeks of waiting I got feedback from the recruiter and was informed that I did not qualify for the job after all. My impression is that Google is looking for people who excel in specific areas, not allrounders. And don't expect them to be impressed by any soft/language skills you might bring along.",One of the sessions was about system design. The question was extremely vague but the questions I was asked were very specific. I guess the biggest part of the solution was to infer what exactly the interviewer was getting at.   Answer Question

Then 1-3 phone interviews depending on how well you do.If you make it, you will be invited to on-site interviews, which are typically 4-5 interviews on one day with different interviewers which are Google software engineers with more than 3 years of experience. You will have lunch with another Google software engineer, too, which will give you the opportunity to ask all kinds of questions.The interviewers usually do not ask much about you or your past work experience, 90% of the interview time gets spend with coding and logical thinking questions.

The interviewers are told not give much feedback and some of them follow this rule to an uncomfortable extent. You will definitely need to code something within the interviews, but you can find about 75% of the coding challenges by clicking through the first ten pages of Google interview reports.Hints:- Think out loud.- Try to find out how much feedback the interviewer is willing to give by asking clarifying questions.- Prepare by doing some coding beforehand.- Start with a simple solution but mention that there might be better ones and think about them later.",Signed NDA.

Google,"Apr 29, 2010",No Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,I applied through an employee referral. The process took 3 days. I interviewed at Google in March 2010.,"Quick phone call with a recruiter to schedule two interviews. She asked me what language I'd like to be interviewed in. My recent experience is primarily C, but I was expecting to be given the sort of high-level algorithmic problems for which having to build my own data structures would be too time consuming, so I said I would prefer C++. We scheduled my interview to be two weeks away to give me some time to teach myself C++ and the STL.I was supposed to have two interviews on the same day, but one of the interviewers never called me. The one who did call was very friendly and intelligent, but I was caught a bit off guard that all he wanted to ask me were C string manipulation questions. I'd normally be good at this sort of stuff, but I was surprised and I panicked, and I didn't do as well as I should have.My other interview was rescheduled for a couple of days later. Once again, I really liked me interviewer. He asked me some higher-level algorithmic questions, with a bit of an AI bent to the them. Interesting stuff. It was interesting stuff, and I eventually came to the solutions he was looking for, but it took some prompting.In the end, I wasn't invited to a second round of interviews and I wasn't particularly surprised by this. There's a huge difference between writing your own code on your own time or even on a test in school and writing code with someone watching your every keystroke. I found it very stressful.

Google,"Feb 8, 2010",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,I applied online. The process took 2+ months.

Had a phone interview the next week, where the interviewer asked a little bit about my past experience, a few language specific questions, programming concepts/data structures and then gave me a coding assignment to mail back in an hour.Received feedback within a few days that they wanted to bring me onsite for an interview, but that was around the holidays, so we didn't schedule anything until after the holiday season. I prepared for the interview by going over the links they provided (topcoder.com, etc) and dug up my old college course notes. When I got there, I had 5 interviews and a lunch. Had to write code for all of the interviews, but the final interview was more high level and pseudocode was allowed. (The other interviews all required syntactically correct code). The interviews all took the same form - asked a little about something on my resume, a code question, analysis of your solution (big-O, etc) and a design-type question. There were no brain-teasers or trivia questions.The one thing I did not like about the interviews - but am not at all surprised at - is that they aren't too interested in selling you on the company or helping you find out what working there would be like. None of the interviewers bothered to tell me what they did, what group they worked for or what their title was.

Google,"Sep 10, 2010",No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,I applied through a recruiter. The process took 4+ weeks. I interviewed at Google in July 2010.,"So a Google recruiter calls me and I get all excited. I'm fairly happy with my current employer, but, after all, it's Google. I talk to the recruiter and we discuss a few things like where I would like to work, etc. I ask them:- ""Are you looking for any particular background - web, databases, storage, networking?""- ""Oh, no no, we're just looking for generally smart people.""Ok fair enough. Recruiter 1 hands me off to Recruiter 2. Recruiter 2 then hands me off to Recruiter 3 who's, finally, local to my area. Cool.Step 1: Phone interview. I talk to a ""person who is around my level"". They ask me to write some code using Google Docs. Pretty easy.Step 2: Round 1. Two one-hour sessions. Both times I'm given some code printouts (in language of my choice) and asked deeply technical questions. The first hour is in the form of ""this code does not work, why? Ok you found a bug, fix it. Ok now when we run this, it does this, why?""... and so forth. The second hour, there's a lot more code and two interviewers at once. I was told that one of them is a ""junior interviewer"". The problem is, they interrupt each other asking questions as I'm trying to solve things on the board. As I try to explain a solution to interviewer 1, interviewer 2 randomly jumps in: ""so what do you think the running time is?"" Nice way to stress one out... At the end of that, they tell me it's ok to be a little stressed out.Step 3: Round 2. Three one-hour sessions. Now, each time, I am not given much and asked to write code on the board. I felt like I did OK with interviewers 1 and 2 but interviewer 3 was very difficult to communicate with. He would describe a board game puzzle in a very silent manner and then not really ask a question. Several times I had to ask him ""uhh, I guess you would like me to write a function that does XYZ?"" And then get a very subtle nod back. I wrote some stuff but couldn't tell if he was impressed, indifferent, or expected something else completely. In any case, I feel like that was the part I blew.Note that at no point were my experience, past employment accomplishments, management skills, personality, interests, or career goals ever discussed.Step 4: Wait for two weeks. After a week I emailed the recruiter and the response was ""Sorry, one of the people who interviewed you had not submitted their feedback yet"". I showed that to some very senior developers in my network who laughed and said ""dude, that's a good sign that the organization is slowly rotting"".Step 5: Get rejection voicemail. The reason being that I'm ""not quite the right fit for the engineering roles we have open"". Fair enough. ""We're generally looking for smart people"" came to mind. Thanks a lot Google! :)Step 6: Two weeks later get a phone call from Google Recruiter 4 who wants to talk to me about employment opportunities at Google! No joke!

Google,"Oct 5, 2010",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,I applied through a recruiter. The process took 2+ months. I interviewed at Google in September 2010.,"I got an initial indication of interest e-mail from a recruiter at Google who had my resume on file from a while back. He asked me a couple standard non-technical questions, and then set up a phone interview.My phone interview consisted of a couple sanity checks (e.g. ""What does static mean in C++?"") followed by one very tough technical question which lasted the entire interview.That went well, so they brought me onsite, where I had 5 technical interviews, all 45 minutes each. They always seemed to run up to the limit/a couple minutes over, I think they should consider making the time longer. In the middle of the day I had lunch with an engineer for an hour who fielded whatever questions I had, but they don't provide feedback, so feel free to ask anything.Each interview pretty much followed the same format -- they presented the question, asked me to go, I would say something like ""Well the naive way to do it is ___, but let's look for the better way"", but they would ask me to code the naive way anyway (usually). Then they would ask me how inefficient it is, how to improve it, and then ask me to code that. They wanted code (or pseudo code, if there were only a couple minutes left) in almost all situations -- they write it all down or just take a picture. At the end, each one turns it around to see if you have any questions for them.My recruiter gave me status updates along the way, letting know what my status was, and it took about 3 weeks to hear back.People: a couple interviewers seemed grumpy, like they didn't want to be there -- I didn't like that. But everybody, including the grumps, were really excited about their job, and really liked all their benefits/perks/freedom/situation in general.Advice: the interviews are tough! Expect at least a couple months to review if you're rusty; study lots of books like CLRS; do a **lot** of practice problems (TopCoder is a very good resource); practice problems on the white board (I found this especially useful); bring in your own skinny white board markers -- the ones in the interview rooms are fat and hard to write with; be prepared to talk through your solution; bring several questions for all the interviewers (even just ""how do you like your job?""); for things like quicksort/mergesort/merge/binary search, you should be able to write that in your sleep while you're drunk.

I interviewed at Google in April 2012.,"I applied to a job at Google using their website. The position was Software Engineer in Mountain View.After posting my CV I received an email in which I was invited to an interview. The first interview was with an HR person, simple talk, short, nothing special. I was programmed for another phone interview a week after the first one. This time it was a technical one.I was given a Google doc link and I had to use that document to write the algorithm for a problem that my interviewer presented to me. The problem was significantly less complex than I expected, similar to the ones that we used to do in high-school when studying algorithms. Unfortunately I did not performed well. The interview was scheduled at evening, in my timezone(I am not from the US) and after an chaotic day at work I could not concentrate as I should.One advice that I would give is to focus on the problem, not on the person talking to you. I did this huge mistake, I was more preoccupied on explaining him what I wanted to do that I could not focus on getting the problem done. I kept explaining to him my every thought so I ran out of time. I am not saying to think and write the code without any explanation since you may get a hint or two from the one holding the interview. At first I started on the wrong path since I was so eager to get to the solution.Please stop, think it through, analyze your solution than expose it and try to code it. Maybe this may help someone. I wish I could have another chance. If I had stopped and think without jumping to code it, the outcome would have been another one.

Most engineers in Google, Bangalore do what I have been doing for 4-5 years, yet none of their interviews were focused on my past projects. Apparently, Google claims that they look at the candidate's thought process, it's wasn't so in my case! I got 2 questions partially correct and *I think* I did well in all others in 5 interviews and still got rejected. The feedback from the recruiter was that a ""a couple of interviews went well but a couple others didn't go so well""Insider story is that every interviewer gives you a score1- no hire2- no hire, but unsure3- hire, but unsure4- hireYou must get an average score > 3.5 for the local hiring committee to approve your application. I think mine got scraped at the local level itself.Overall, the interview experience was positive. I had a couple of easy phone screens and they provided to and fro tickets to Bangalore, accommodation and local transport. The pace of the interviews was comfortable, there was free lunch and everyone was on time.My recruiter was very unprofessional. She didn't get back to me until 1.5 months after the interview was done. I must have sent her 6 follow up emails and she didn't bother responding to any one of them. A short note asking me to wait for some more time would have been very helpful. A rule of thumb is if the recruiter isn't calling back and checking up if you have an offer at hand etc., they are not that interested in you.Note that references from engineers working in Google matter a lot. Google also does a background check if you have peers inside and you cannot lie - I was asked if I had worked with certain people already in the company. I had a nasty ex-colleague in Google who because of team dynamics was pitched as my competition (I know, petty politics!). If you have such a case, don't write his/her name.

Know your data structures and algorithms back to front; be prepared for questions as high-level as very general OOP design problems and as low-level as bit manipulations; and know your resume cold, because every interviewer was interested in at least one item on it.I HIGHLY recommend finding a copy of at least one coding interview book (Cracking the Coding Interview, Programming Interviews Exposed, and Design & Analysis of Algorithms served me well) and tackling the problems in it -- they will give you a good idea of what to expect. I will say that I had never seen any of the questions I was asked in my Google interviews (whereas the rest of the industry seems to recycle the same 20 questions over and over), but my practice with general interview-style coding questions was extremely useful nonetheless.Remember that the interviewer wants to see how you approach a problem you haven't necessarily seen before, so think out loud a lot, and don't forget your edge cases!   Answer Question"

Google,"Jun 23, 2012",No Offer,Neutral Experience,Difficult Interview,I applied through a recruiter. The process took 3+ months. I interviewed at Google in June 2012.,"The process: Recruiter contacted me via Linkedin, had some phone/email conversations, then talked to someone at Google to decide to apply or not. Had a phone interview then on-site. The on-site was 5 separate interviews plus lunch.The process is pretty long, though the turnaround between phone interview and on-site was quicker than other steps. One of the flaws of the process is that they don't have things together... the phone interviewer didn't know if I'd been notified about the phone interview (he hadn't when he interviewed) and so we didn't use Google Docs for coding - just more general questions. Something like 3 of my on-site interviewers were replaced last-minute, room confusion, lateness, etc. Follow-up with recruiter tended to be a day after it was supposed to be.The coding questions are much like you've seen on this site and others. There was a focus on tough general algorithms questions. I understand that they like to use variations on actual problems they've encountered, but they seemed to be (mostly) artifacts from such a heavy focus on distributed computing. I don't get to do distributed computing in my normal duties, so I was unprepared. The other downside is that there seemed to be too much focus on computational complexity and not as much on readability, maintainability, development time constraints.The hardest part is that placement doesn't happen until the time of the offer. So you don't know if you'll actually want to go until you're really invested in it.My advice for interviewers: Work on hard graduate-level algorithms problems to prepare, slight focus to the weird sorts of things you have to do for distributed programming. If the interviewer is asking you a design question, make sure they clarify what they're actually for.My advice for Google: Try to mesh the questions with the candidate's background better. Give more clear in-interview feedback about whether the solution is adequate, how it could be better. Allow for more time for the candidate to ask questions. There's no downtime at all for almost 6 hours, so maybe an easy question after lunch? Give more detailed feedback about specific weaknesses. Spend some time convincing the candidate that this is a good fit for their experience (or not) - without a job description you don't even know if it's interesting or not.All this sounds very negative but you can really feel the excitement on Google campus."," They ask you not to reveal questions, so I won't.   1 Answer"

Google,"Jan 29, 2015",No Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,I applied through an employee referral. The process took 3 weeks. I interviewed at Google in December 2014.,"Contacted by a recruiter after a former co-worker from another company that is now in Google recommended me.First screening interview was on site since I live close to Google's offices in Tel-Aviv.Small algorithm/data-structure question with coding in C++ and a bit of STL.The interviewer was not very nice, snobish and condescending, yet I passed without any issues and was invited to a full on-site interviews day at a later date.The on-site interviews included 3 interviews focusing on algorithm/data-structures including a bit of coding. Nothing very difficult, but requiring good knowledge of topics like trees/lists traversal, dynamic programming, binary search, etc.One interview was on C++ knowledge, basic stuff like virtual functions, multiple inheritance, etc. with a small algorithm and coding question.Last interview was a design interview - design an image sharing system in which users can upload images, then get a short URL unique for their image and use it in forum messages, social networks posts, emails, etc.I was told by the recruiter that the feedback was mixed but with enough support for passing to the hiring committee.Then I was rejected and told by recruiter that the design interview is the cause. I find this decision very wrong, considering what I accomplished in my career and am sure 100% that any former colleague of mine would testify very positively on my design skills, but think back on the design interview I'm not surprised:The interviewer gave me a pen and papers so I could draw and write my design, but as soon as he finished asking the question he picked a pen and paper and started solving it himself, he seemed to be in a hurry to reach exactly the solution that he expects. He was not nice, arrogant and unpleasant to talk to and have an open discussion.In total 3 of the 6 interviewers were not people I would like to work with, while the other 3 were very nice and were fun to talk to and think together.I wasn't asked even once on my work experience or any of my past projects, no single ""behavior"" question like ""describe a scenario in which you had a conflict"", etc. and wasn't asked why I would like to join Google or what I'm looking for in a work place.It seems the entire process revolves around solving technical questions and nothing beyond that, so it's not surprising to me that 3 of 6 interviewers (in my opinion of course) had such bad people skills.I constantly had the feeling that the interviewers (all of them) prefer meek and inexperienced candidates, that can be shaped and trained to think exactly like them and would not show independent or out-of-the-box thinking.*** It actually felt to me like my experience and knowledge is an obstacle or a disadvantage instead of an asset that the company would and should appreciate !!! ***Other than that - I enjoyed solving the questions, food was great (and the engineer that escorted me was very nice and friendly, we had interesting discussions), the offices look and feel great. The recruiter was super friendly, always kept me informed and did his best to speed up the process, I have only good words to say about him.I later passed successfully interviews in other companies (including Google's competitors), some of which were more difficult, and received excellent offers from great work places, and I definitely think the process in Google leads to bad decisions.I was offered by the recruiter to try again in 12 months, but I have no such intention, nor would I recommend it to talented people that I know."," I wouldn't describe any question as ""difficult"", but they definitely require you to be practiced on data structures and basic algorithms.

I interviewed at Google in May 2015.,"I applied to Google through my university's online job portal. I was contacted by a recruiter a few weeks later. She asked me about my classes, projects and if I would be willing to move to Mountain View. She also asked me for my programming language preference. She then scheduled the first phone interview. I did reasonably well on the first phone screening but I didn't completely nail it so they scheduled a second phone interview (instead of flying me off for the on-site). My second interview was borderline and the recruiter told me that they will pass over my application for now. She encouraged me to get some industry experience and contact her again in 12 months. The recruiter was pretty nice and helpful. But she had a habit of responding to emails late. A week or more. Overall not a bad experience. The interview questions were reasonable and the interviewers themselves were also helpful."," First interview -Warmup:The interviewer asked me a series of short questions. The running time (best, worst, average) of various sorting algorithms such as merge sort, quick sort and heapsort. He also asked me about hash table and hash functions (average and worst case complexity of insertion, deletion and lookup).Central Question:Consider a setup where a program is continuously receiving floats as inputs (a stream of numbers). The task is to write a method that at any given time returns a moving average. That is the average of the last k numbers received. If the method is called before the program has received k numbers, simply return the average of however many numbers have been received thus far. The solution should obviously be optimal.Second interview -Warmup: Given an array of integers, write a method that places all the zeros at the end.Main question: Consider an interface which has the following two methods:interface Counter {  void inc();  int getLastMinuteCount();}The method inc() is supposed to help keep track of the number of requests that clients make to a server (or something else along those lines). The getLastMinuteCount() is supposed to return the number of requests that the server has received in the last minute. The question is to implement a class that has these two methods included.   2 Answers"

I interviewed at Google in May 2015.,"I applied to Google and Facebook at roughly the same time.

Then there was over a week of silence, and finally recruiter called me on different hour that I specified. He said that he has one possible date for phone interview, so I accepted.2. My first phone interview did not happen, because interviewer did not show up. Interview was rescheduled.3. Second interview went smoothly. I answered all the questions, and interviewer seemed satisfied with the answers.4. The same day recruiter called me and said that my evaluation was inconclusive and we need another phone interview. I asked for technical feedback, but I was not given any. The only information that I received was that ""my solution was not good enough"".5. Second interview went similar to the first one.

After a week recruiter called me and said that evaluation was inconclusive again, and this ends recruitment process.

I used it to complain about lack of information from recruiter and the fact that I still do not know why I was rejected.9. The next morning I got a call from my recruiter. He apologized for not contacting me earlier and gave me technical feedback from my two interviews. I learned that first call I failed because my solution was not optimal (it was O(N log N) when O(N) was possible). On the second call I implemented optimal algorithm, but there were several issues with implementation that led to lowering my evaluation to ""neutral"".

Google,"May 25, 2016",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,I applied through an employee referral. The process took 3 weeks. I interviewed at Google in May 2016.,"The whole process started with a very nice and helpful call with the recruiting staff who explained everything and answered all my questions. She led me through the whole interview process and scheduled my phone interview.At the telephone interview itself I got a call from an Google Software Engineer who was first of all upset that the hangout did not work which he told me was of course my fault. After that he gave me a rough coding question which I could not understand at all. After I've asked back a few times he told me could not help me at the interview. This made me not confident at all and I have to say I got a little bit nervous. Anyway, I started coding and tried to solve a problem which I couldn't really understand from the beginning. I tried to ask a few other questions, but I think the interviewer had some other work to do since seemed a little bit distracted. After I finished a first answer I told the interviewer a few times that I'm finished now until he reacted. He went quickly to my code and then told me that I have forgotten a some aspects I wasn't asked for in the first place. After 30min of stressful coding and asking back I finally figured out what was asked from me but this had required to change the whole code from scratch. So I tried to fix it with 15min left and coded as fast as I could. After exactly 40min (not 45) the interviewer told me that he had seen enough, said good by and hung up.In summary, I could not get what was asked from me in the beginning alltough the problem (a simple graph search on a regular grid) itself wasn't hard at all. Of course I did not get to the next stage because my answer was not good enough. I was really disappointed by the interviewer. He seemed not interested to tell me the question correctly and was distracted by something else. In my opinion this is totally inappropriate in an interview process.",Find out if a graph exists in a regular grid (all nodes connected)   Answer Question
Google,"May 18, 2016",No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,I applied through a recruiter. The process took 1 day. I interviewed at Google.,"Initially, I got an in mail from Google's recruiter asking for me considering a position at Google due to my experience. I graduated CS MSc studies over a decade ago. I replied that I am unfortunately pretty busy now. After a while he contacted me again, asking if I am maybe available now, I decided to proceed, because I wanted to know what kind of projects they can offer.He then asked me few easy questions, next we have set up some tech interview call with an engineer. The following phone interview was surprisingly easy and enjoyable. After one week I received very positive feedback and was asked for on-site interviews to one of the European sites.We have set up not really distant date - 2 weeks later. I was informed that one-site interview will take 5 rounds and will be more in-depth and challenging. I was given also some materials, book recommendations. During these 2 weeks I did some preparations refreshing the general knowledge on algorithms, coding tricks and skimming through these book. But I didn't want to spend too much time on it, as it was barely used in my professional work, expecting that they want to evaluate my specialization anyway.Some time later, I have arrived at the site, I was welcomed by HR lady, very nice and cheerful and I was saw me to the interview room. Pretty small, no windows. I'd expect some more comfortable interviewing place from such big company.Then I was introduced to the first interviewer, I was informed that it is my fellow countryman. He briefly said hello, informed that we are gonna speak English only from now one and started writing some generic coding puzzle question on the board. No introduction, no chit-chat, no questions about myself or my experience. Overcoming the first impression, I first wrote a brute force solution (telling it's gonna be brute-force first). Once I finished, he took took a photo with his phone, then threw ""can you make it better"". I started giving some ideas, but he was just staring at me without any interest, finally he said he don't understand what I am saying, and gave a hint. I realized he wants a modification of some puzzle from the Cracking the code int, I did write the code. He again took a photo and left without the word.2nd interviewer was nicer. But the 2nd question was again coding puzzle, nothing to do with my experience, quite similar to 1st one too. But at least this interviewer was giving me a feedback in what direction he wants to optimize, and soon we reached a good point, he said he got what he wanted, we had some less format chat.3rd interviewer was 30 min late, it was only 15 minutes left of his time! We rushed in hurry doing some solution for caching DB responses. Nothing to do with my experience, again! It was simple in overall, but I had only 15 minutes to show my ideas. The interviewer was okay and matter-of-fact.4th interviewer was asking me how would I design some Google specific stuff/system. Looked like a higher grade employee. And again nothing specific to my experience! We talked quite a lot, to came to the question if I know MapReduce, I said I heard of it, but not really. He said, ""you've just described it"". Weird!5th interviewer started with pointing out that my CV is done in LaTeX, and he used to use LaTeX when he made his PhD (emphasizing PhD for some reason). That was the first time someone said anything about my CV. When I responded saying LaTeX is programmer friendly, he ignored what I said and just started asking an interview question. And again it had nothing to do with my experience, and it was 3rd coding puzzle this day. I was feeling really disappointed. Regardless of that, I started clearing out the details and assumptions, I gave the brute force solution and started optimizing that. I reached some point of optimization for read and write, be he said he now wants O(1) on write, not saying anything about read, I immediately gave him an answer, that was correct, but really ignoring the write performance. He seemed to be irritated. The interview soon ended and he escorted me out of the office and briefly said goodbye. And this was the end of the on-site interview.I left feeling really confused, it was nothing close to what it was supposed to be according the nice youtube videos. I walked a bit in the city and then flew back home. 2 weeks later I have received a feedback from hiring committee saying that my performance was ""mixed"" and I did code well but my answers could be some times cleaner and more efficient, so they don't decide to proceed. No details given what was exactly wrong. They said also I can re-apply in 1 year. Yeah, I cannot wait to do that. Or wait, I can.Altogether it was negative but very valuable experience. I guess it can work for a fresh graduate, or topcoder fan, but if you want to get a job done and coding riddles are no fun anymore, because life is more about that, this process can be surprising for you."," On the phone: write a set class, after clarification certain range integers set.On the site: (1) number of triples in integer set that satisfy some property (2) find the length of longest substring that satisfies some property, optimize for streaming solution (no looking back) (3) design DB response aching (4) design search field autocompletion (server-side, architecture) (5) a bitset with bit range flip operation   Answer Question"

Google,"Mar 23, 2016",No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,I applied online. The process took 2 weeks. I interviewed at Google (Zürich (Switzerland)) in February 2016.,"I applied online and was contacted by a recruiter. First interview was with the recruiter. Google Hangout. He explained the interview process and asked some very easy technical questions. Pleasant conversation. Next step was the real phone screening with a Google employee.Now, I had quite some time to prepare so I studied well. I thought I knew everything. Binary trees, BFS, DFS, Dynamic Programming, Prefix/Suffix trees, Heaps, Hash tables, and so forth. I knew all the important algorithms and data structures and I practiced enough to know how to apply them in clever ways. I also did a lot of leetcode questions without much difficulty, including most of the ""hard"" ones.Despite all this I still failed the interview. Frustratingly, the question really wasn't that difficult. It didn't require any advanced algorithms knowledge. Without going into specifics, what needed to be done was to go through an array, for each index recognize one out of three cases, and update some variables accordingly. What went wrong is that I didn't take my time to think this simple problem through. Instead I started coding immediately, produced something messy, and kept on trying to fix this mess. Understandably, this didn't make a good impression.So, my advice to anyone facing the same situation is the following: First of all, relax. Don't be afraid to take some time to think about the problem before you code, so that you know what you're doing once you start coding. Also don't be afraid to stop, rethink, and start over, if you feel you got stuck. Apart from that, always think out loud and listen to the hints of the interviewer.Also, practice coding in a plain text document. I realized that I really got used to syntax highlighting and code completion and had a bit of trouble writing down code in a shared google doc.",What is something you did that you're particularly proud of?   Answer Question

Once I passed the screen, I was interviewed by an engineer via the phone and asked to solve a problem, using Google Docs as the medium. You have to speak your thoughts out loud in order to get the interviewer to follow your train of thought.Once that was passed, I went through a grueling ~5 hour on-site interview with five different interviewers, with a lunch break in-between. Each interviewer put forth a single problem to solve, which was relatively straightforward to answer but contained an edge-case that was annoying to deal with. There was one exception, where I didn't quite understand what the interviewer was talking about (whether the problem was on my end or his, I don't know, but the question in general made no sense without prior knowledge of the larger problem he was trying to solve... it really lacked structure compared to the other problems put forth).Unfortunately, the quality of the interviews varied greatly. I thought two of the engineers conducted themselves very professionally, but one was on his phone 90% of the interview, one talked more about himself and his work rather than spend time interviewing me, and one seemed to lack any form of social skills. I had really high expectations going into the interview, and left quite disappointed.The entire process itself was actually quite fast; they did a good job expediting the process when I asked, and the recruiter who was handling my case was kind enough to return my call even though I was rejected (many companies will not do this).",I don't believe we're allowed to talk about the specific problems asked.   Answer Question

If you haven't seen a similar problem before and need some time to figure out how to do it, you're unlikely to get a great feedback from your interviewer.

Google,"Jul 25, 2016",No Offer,Neutral Experience,Difficult Interview,I applied through a recruiter. I interviewed at Google.,"I have actually interviewed twice with Google, at two locations (Europe and HQ), so I'll combine the results of both interviews. As is noted here, process is usually three steps:1. Initial contact call (possible light technical questions)2. 1/2 VOIP technical screenings3. On-site 5 x 45 min with lunch full interview dayMost reviewers focus on 2 & 3, but it might be worth not forgetting that step 1 might throw a few scripted technical questions at you. It's certainly possible a strong candidate could be filtered out at this stage, if they make the mistake of coming into the call completely cold, and blanking on something not-entirely-trivial such as *worst* cases of the common sorting algorithms...I think also there is a large gap between the difficulty of the pre-screening and on-site stages. This may well lull you into a full sense of security. Also, the difficulty of the tasks on the day can also vary quite a lot. Some of my domain-specific questions were trivial, or at least that's because I'm, unfortunately, highly specialised.You will of course get plenty of low-level algorithm questions, including those somewhat dressed up to conceal the textbook techniques that apply. Also, it's highly likely that you'll be thrown a curve-ball or two; in my case I did get a reasonably ""mathematics"" question. Unfortunately, your ability to handle the pressure of the situation will have a *large* bearing on your success. That maths question, for example, coming at the end of the day, was a real killer. As a mature (30s) candidate who was an A student at pure math in his teens, it's a really disheartening to be flummoxed by something like this.I also had a design session the second time, which is nice because as a mature applicant - although with ""only"" 6-years in the industry - I would be hoping to be in lead roles. Good feedback from the recruiter, actually, since I made the blunder of not using a *very* top down approach. Perhaps it's easy to make this mistake, though, since a session like this is such a gear change from the rest, which will be decidedly bottom up.Organisation of the process was *fairly* good. I know the recruiter had some issues organising the interviewers, and this caused things to be finalised quite last minute. My second interview was moved closer to home as a result, which is actually a benefit. Interviewers were mostly well prepared and professional. The ""vibe"" in the interview is, of course, highly dependent on your performance. Sessions that go badly for you are likely to feel much less comfortable.I would put myself somewhat in the skeptic camp with regards to these kinds of technical interview processes. I have also interviewed at Facebook, where the process is very similar (although somewhat less academically oriented). Whilst I understand that these companies have their reasons for using this kind of process, it will be quite disheartening to a large number of strong candidates who hit that false-negative filter. In my own case, after a quite a few rejections trying to join a US tech giant through the coding avenue, I have to question whether it's even worth persisting. My suspicion is that these roles are for a ""certaind kind of people"", are skewed towards recent graduates and coding competition hobbyists, and ""aren't for people like me"". Personally, I have to consider carefully if it is worth pursuing future attempts, including constantly reviewing coding-challenge style material in my spare time over a period of 2/3 years now."," Broadly from what I remember:Implemented some simple tree recursion, including ""indentation"".Implemented a cached object factoryOptimising search for subsets within both the source and target data-sets - based around a bingo game where both the ""called numbers"" and the player game cards would need to be processed for efficient look up.

Google,"Aug 2, 2016",No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,I applied through a recruiter. The process took 4+ weeks. I interviewed at Google (Warsaw (Poland)) in July 2016.,"The hiring process took over a month. The onsite interviews were very well organised, all interviewers seemed friendly, no problems there. After around a week my recruiter informed me that all feedback was submitted and that it will be presented to a hiring committee. I was very surprised to hear that the committee did not make any decision on my case and asked for external and internal references. This already seemed a bit unusual for a hiring process for a new grad software engineer... Still, I gathered the references which were very positive and my recruiter submitted them again to a hiring committee. This time my recruiter said the decision was ""yes, if we can get a supportive team at Google"", so we started looking for a potential team match. I went through two additional phone interviews with managers from two different offices. One of the managers said he would be happy to have me on his team and wrote a strong letter of support for the hiring committee to review. I was really surprised when my recruiter informed me after that that their decision was still negative. When I expressed my surprise, she finally said that my case was borderline from the beginning and there was not much chance of me getting through... I am wondering why they haven't told me that sooner and kept asking for more information which took a lot of time and effort to gather. The whole process rolled over for a few weeks and I had to keep other companies which made me offers waiting until Google finally made a decision. This really was a negative experience and I think that there are serious problems with the hiring process at Google. Not only do they not feel bad about keeping the candidates waiting for weeks but also ask for other information such as references and team support letters which is pretty unusual for a hiring process for a new grad. Five onsite interviews is already a lot and it should be enough for them to make a timely decision.",NAN

I mentioned this but was told there was no time and we had to get straight into the coding (the interview phoned 5 minutes late so there was not any time for intros etc.) The questions are purposely open ended for you to ask clarifying questions, this was difficult as we could not hear eachother properly. Sometimes I would ask a question and get no answer, other times I would have to ask the interviewer to repeat themselves due to the line dropping.

I interviewed at Google (Tel Aviv-Yafo (Israel)) in May 2018.,"I was reffered by an employee and applied to three positions through Google's job site. A couple of weeks later, I was approached by one of their recruiters.When the recruiter detailed the interview process, she asked me what programming language I feel most comfortable to be interviewed with - I answered JavaScript. But they told me JavaScript is not a programming language, ""it has to be at least Python"" (although I know a friend who interviewed to the same position and asked for JavaScript and got it.)So I chose Python after all, as that's my second-most-comfortable language. I could select anytime to have the interview, but I wanted a near date, as with my experience with Google, if you don't use the momentum of an opportunity, it could fade away on their end, from multiple unplanned reasons.I got a long email from the recruiter with many resources to learn. The not-fun part was that I got a list of books in that email, but didn't even have time to order them from Amazon to have enough time to use them for learning before the interview. I ended up preparing online in LeetCode and HackerRank and more.The first interview is a rough filtering of candidates. They call it a Phone Screen but tell you to come on-site, and then the interview is a face-to-face interview, which is weird.I also didn't appreciate the very first sentence the interviewer told me in the interview: ""other than technically testing you, we don't talk in this interview, no need to explain, because it could be a waste of time"". Even if it's a reasonable way to go, it's not the way to present it to an interviewee.I had a good interview, but I didn't make it this time around. Honestly, it was doable, objectively.

Google,"Oct 10, 2018",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,I applied through other source. The process took 2 weeks. I interviewed at Google (Zürich (Switzerland)) in October 2018.,"Google selected my resume because I reached round 2 of google code jam.A recruiter set up a call with an engineer at google for the telephonic round. I had spent nearly 6 months practicing coding before this interview, including solving 200+ problems on leetcode. Due to this preparation I did relatively well in code jam this year. I also knew few of my former colleagues who went on to the on-site stage at google and couldn't reach round 2 in code jam. So I was confident to at least clear the telephonic round.Oh boy was I wrong! The interview was a nightmare. The interviewer had this thick Russian/European accent and he made many basic grammatical mistakes while speaking. This made it really difficult to understand what he was trying to say. He asked me a question which was at medium difficulty level on leetcode. I tried to articulate my thought process to him and came up with a solution to the problem in 15 minutes. I am not completely sure if he understood what I was trying to say. I asked him if I can start coding the solution that I proposed and he said yes. I started writing code and 5 minutes into the coding phase, the interviewer started writing next lines of code. He started explaining the solution that he had in mind while writing the code for it himself. I was shocked. At this point I stopped coding and tried to understand the solution the interviewer was trying to propose and couldn't make any sense of it. The interviewer kept on explaining his solution and at one point he stopped explaining. I asked him if I can implement the solution that I proposed initially, and he just ignored what I said and continued explaining his code.At the end of this torture, he asked me if I had any questions about google. I asked him to give his feedback about google. I think he did not understand my question. Because in reply, he did not answer this question but made an unrelated statement. He said, at google, we don't tolerate inefficient solutions and when he discusses technical topics with his friends outside google, he is shocked at the poor quality and inefficient systems they are building.",NAN

I interviewed at Google (Zürich (Switzerland)) in September 2018.,"I was contacted by a recruiter from Google. I had a brief talk with him on Hangouts. We talked about the role and the interview process.The next step was a phone technical interview with an Engineer. This lasted 45 min, and was composed of only data structures and algorithms questions. The Engineer was not very welcoming, he went straight to the point. I barely passed this stage, but I was given detailed feedback by the recruiter afterwards, which was appreciated.I was then invited by another recruiter onsite at Google Zurich. Flights and hotel (1 night) were booked by Google, so there was little cost for those few days in Zurich. I took the opportunity to do some sightseeing.The recruiter took care of me throughout the day. I had 2 interviews in the morning, then a lunch break with an Engineer, and then 2 other interviews. The interviews were all under the same format : a problem to clarify, solve and write code on. I was able to write code on a laptop instead of a blackboard, which I found very nice.The interview questions were very hard, and Google expects you to go through and finish the coding in the alloted time. Some of the Engineers were very friendly and pleasant, while others preferred to talk only about the problem at hand, which did not put me at ease. The lunch break was very nice and relaxing.After the interviews, I had a coffee with the two recruiters, which was quite nice.After some days, I was told the results were not strong enough, with again detailed feedback.Overall it was a nice experience, largely due to very nice and helpful recruiters."," Given a string, compute the length of the largest substring which contains at most k different characters.Ex: ""aaabbbbbcc"" with k = 2 -> 8   1 Answer"
Google,"Oct 19, 2018",Declined Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,I applied through a recruiter. The process took 2+ months. I interviewed at Google (Sydney (Australia)) in October 2018.,"The whole process took two months, the time frame of the process is up to you, depending on when you schedule your phone/onsite interviews.Phone interview started of with a 5 minute intro followed by a single coding question for 35 minutes, with follow ups. The question is presented in a very general abstract manner and it's up to you to ask questions and make assumptions to translate that into an actual function. The last 5 minutes of the interview involved asking the software engineer questions about working at Google.The onsite interviews were very similar to your phone interviews such that they're face to face with the interviewer in the room and you had a choice of using a whiteboard or a chromebook or even both to help you answer the coding questions.They are all back to back interviews ranging to 45 minutes with a lunch break after the third interview. All of the interviewers will dive straight into the coding problem and assess your entire performance from there.Overall the recruiters and schedule coordinators were amazing, they responded really quickly and were very supportive and accommodating. I was able to reschedule my phone interview twice due to not feeling prepared and they were totally fine with that.Free lunch was totally awesome and would do another interview there again if I fail just for the sake of it.

The interviewer's attitude was also sort of discouraging.While Google interviews are famed for their depth of coverage and number of rounds, it's difficult for the candidate to guage the purpose of a question.

It was made by 4 45 minutes interviews back to back with a lunch break in the middle (the person who comes with you for the lunch won't submit feedbacks, so you can really enjoy the meal!).Every interview had the same structure: no introduction and the coding question was asked at the very beginning. You can choose to use either the whiteboard or a Chromebook.I would suggest to find directly the almost optimal solution without mentioning other ""brute force"" solutions seen that you would lose time discussing them and you will have less time for the coding part.For the coding part you should be really fast to demonstrate that you master the language of your choice. I would recommend to use the language that you use in your day-to-day work (it can really make the difference).Please make sure to review the code you write by considering all edge cases and limitations; remember also to validate the input.At the end of the interviews, you will have 2/3 minutes for questions.The interviewers will take note of everything you say and write (in case of whiteboard coding, they will take some pictures).The questions were completely new to me, difficult but not impossible.Overall it was a great experience, and I would recommend to everyone interested in working at Google to try it at least once in the life.

Google,"Apr 25, 2019",No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,I applied through a recruiter. The process took 3+ months. I interviewed at Google (Zürich (Switzerland)) in April 2019.,"I had the on-site interview in Zurich, Switzerland. It consisted of 3+2 rounds of 45 minutes each, with a short lunch break in between. 4 interviews focused mostly on knowledge of data structures and algorithmic thinking, whereas the 5th revolved around system design. I found only 2 of the algorithmic problems particularly difficult, the other 2 were fairly straightforward, but I guess this pretty much depends on the type of problems one has previously been exposed to. The system design interview required prior understanding of cloud-based systems, which I -- as a software engineer who mostly worked for automotive and semiconductor companies -- did not really have, but this did not prove to be a dealbreaker in the end -- I ended up below the bar mostly due to not being fast enough in solving the algorithmic problems and not being knowledgeable enough about some of the more advanced data structures.My experience was fairly positive overall. I especially appreciated the fact that Google provides interviewees with detailed feedback on their performance and advises them on what areas to focus for a possible re-run in 12 months' time -- I don't remember any other company I ever had contact with doing this. So a big thumbs up for this. They also communicated very well and professionally throughout the whole process, the requirements and time scale for every step were always made crystal clear and they offered time for preparation.One aspect I found problematic, though, was the lack of breaks between the interview rounds. I would really have appreciated a 5-10 minutes break before delving into a new problem, just to have a chance to clear up my mind. Going for 6 hours without even a 5 minute break can be painfully exhausting and it makes an already stressful situation more demanding than it should reasonably be.Another issue I have with Google's interview process is that it is somewhat skewed toward fresh graduates, and it places us experienced developers at a disadvantage. 10 years have passed since I last needed to implement binary dearch or Dijkstra's algorithm, whereas a fresh grad probably had an Algorithms & Data Structures course sometime last year. Sure, you can always refresh your memory and re-learn all the algorithms you have forgotten in years of industry work, but it makes the required effort much greater for experienced developers -- especially if you have to prepare for the interview while having a full-time job and a family.",How would you design a cloud-based photo storage and sharing application with a smartphone frontend?   Answer Question
