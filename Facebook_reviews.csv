Facebook,"Aug 25, 2014",No Offer,Neutral Experience,Difficult Interview,I applied through an employee referral. The process took 2 weeks. I interviewed at Facebook in August 2014.,"I was contacted by a Facebook recruiter, and offered an interview for a Software Engineer Internship. I had two interviews, both a combination of talking on the phone and coding on collabedit.com. The first interview took place about five days after I was first contacted about the position; the interviewer asked a few questions about projects I'd done and then started with programming questions. The second interview happened a week later, and the interviewer dove straight into coding problems. I was asked general algorithm questions, like get the n-th Fibonacci number, find the square root of a number, find the depth of a binary tree, merge two arrays, etc. Both interviewers saved time at the end for any questions I wanted to ask them."," Display the sorted output of a merge of any number of sorted arrays.

At this stage, there are 3 possible outcomes: onsite invitation, a phone interview for an additional chance, or reject.

I don't remember signing any NDA at this point so, the questions were k-Nearest Points to Origin, finding a substring, and 3-sum.On-site interview: 3 interviews, 45 mins each. 1st interview: 2 coding questions. 2nd interview: behavioral questions (about team conflict, etc.) and a coding question. 3rd interview: 2 coding questions. Coding questions were easy and required *no knowledge* of special algorithms or data structures (such as graphs, DP, trees, etc). Recursion and strings were common.I did not get an offer from Facebook; however, I received offers from other companies. The interview questions themselves were considerably easier at Facebook than those asked at Google, LinkedIn, MS, Amazon, etc.Since the questions are not very hard, my guess is the decision is based upon fit and most importantly how *quickly* you were able to arrive at your solution and how *perfect* your code was. Make sure you focus and are confident.Advice: practice the easier questions and practice coding them.

I interviewed at Facebook (Menlo Park, CA) in July 2013.","Application was via an internal referral from a friend who used to work at a start-up I was at. He put me in their system and around 4 days later, a recruiter called for first contact.The recruiter was quick to assess what I have done and decide to bring me straight in for a 1h30 min interview the next week. In this session I got a quick ""hi"" from the recruiter and then two 30 min slots, one on architecture and design (so called pirate interview) and the other on coding (ninja). Of the 2, I stormed the coding question but met with an interviewer in the pirate side that had tailored a question from his previous experience in the area I had recently worked in and it didn't work out (mostly as I knew more about the topic and the interviewer wanted to talk about a specific trick he knew). Still, I got called back the next week for a full day.Lunch, more coding, culture interviews etc... Coding and design were knockouts again, the softer skills were less successful. I think the key here is that you need to present a confident, well rehearsed personality with answers for the usual questions (biggest mistake etc...). DO NOT talk about mistakes and then admit you don't know the root cause for them, even if they were true mysteries. Pick another example!!!The process took ~4 weeks, the end dragging out by 2 weeks as it seems they could not decide if it was a hire or not.

Facebook,"May 30, 2013",No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,NAN,"Got referred through a friend at FB. They contacted me 1-2 weeks later via email. Set up a phone chat that the recruiter initially missed, but we rescheduled. Once we had a phone conversation she said they can move really fast: ~1 week to make an offer.I went on site for a first round interview (since I'm local to the area). The interviewer was nice. She asked me to describe what I work on now. Then we jumped into two coding problems. I interpreted the problem as a Hamming Distance problem and asked if it was, she kind of shrugged it off -- I don't think she knew what Hamming Distance meant. I coded a solution on a laptop (new trial process they were doing), but it turned out we were not talking about the same problem. In retrospect, the problem she was describing was Levenshtein Distance. I had the feeling she only knew the solution to the problem because she had the answer sheet.The second problem was another classic DP problem. Finding the sum of 1's in a submatrix. I went on to describe the recurring relation for the subproblem in the linear case. She didn't want me to do that and she quickly said the solution to the 2D case was a generalization of the 1D case.Because of the novelty of the laptop in the interview and the misunderstanding of the initial problem, the recruiter fought for me to do another phone screen even though the first one didn't go that well.The second interview I opted for a phone interview. This time the interviewer seemed more knowledgable and came into FB through an acquisition. I was asked what I work on now and some hard problem I solved in the past. Again two interview questions were asked (using collabedit). The first was to list out all the paths in a binary tree which was simple. I did make some mistakes and corrected it in the code as we talked through use cases. The second problem was checking if a string was a palindrome for strings with symbols and spaces in them which again is easy. I did solve both problems, but in the beginning the interviewer stated he's looking for accuracy and performance. My tree traversal was a simple preorder traversal using recursion and the palindrome involved one loop.Apparently the second interview did not go well even though I provided correct solutions in both. I guess the interviewer was serious when he said he's looking for correctness -- I guess you need to be able to code compilable/error-free code in a text editor.The recruiter and onsite coordinator were very helpful and the interviewers were very friendly. However, the style of FB interviews seems to be that you should study and know by heart common interview puzzles/algorithms/DP problems and be able to reproduce that error free."," Levenshtein Distance, Sum of 1's in a submatrix, Print all paths of a binary tree, Palindrome   Answer Question"

Facebook,"Dec 6, 2013",No Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 3+ months. I interviewed at Facebook (Menlo Park, CA) in November 2013.","This was for a position in their Infrastructure team in Cambridge MA.Recruiter contacted me in September and was very interested in my background and experience with highly scalable systems - both in Finance and Mobile phone payments.I attended some small intimate presentations they did as they were initially opening a new Boston office and wanted to grow it out. The meetings were great and I learned a lot about how they solve some of their biggest problems.I then did a screening interview on-site (because I don't do technical screens well on the phone). The question was ""Given a binary tree, write code to print the tree out line by line"". I did OK and got the Breadth First Search down fine, but couldn't figure out the - line-by-line part. (Turns out this is Facebook's #1 question to ask in interviews).Although my performance wasn't great they gave me a break on that and asked me back for another screening interview. This time I prepared well for another coding interview but it turned out to be a Design interview. The problem was""Imagine you have 10,000 servers and need to monitor the performance of each one, how would you do it"" - naturally you need to be able to NOT take too much of the bandwidth and so you'll have to do sampling, have some history to watch for trends etc.I passed that and was very excited to be flown out to Menlo Park for the final round.I studied like CRAZY based on questions on this site and CareerCup. I took 4 weeks and studied about 15 hours per week.Turns out I focused on the wrong questions - I studied Tree, String, Array and List algorithms based on the distribution of Q&A but I was asked Binary math and heap algorithms. Here are the questions I was asked.1) How would you implement division without +, - or multiplication (a ""classic"" question, but not one of the ones I would focus on). I bombed on this as I was not expecting and could not recall my binary math. I figured out the high level outline but that was all. That I was asked this in the ""culture fit"" interview made this doubly unexpected.2) Given 10,000 servers containing a Billion integers each how would you find how to find the median? I knew the answer to this question (use two heaps) - not because I had focused on it, but I had found it an interesting question while studying. However he then asked ""How much memory do you need?"" and I didn't know how big the heaps would need to be. The real answer I was trying to get is - what is the minimum heap you need. I had a guess but I think I got this wrong.3) Given a List structure where each node contains a Next node and optionally a pointer to another list, flatten that liste.g.L1 --> L2 --> L3 --> L7 --> L8                      |                      v                     L4 --> L5-->L6WIll be flattened toL1 --> L2 --> L3 -->L4 -->L5-->L6-->L7-->L8I did OK on this - getting the answer - but it appeared I took too long. The interviewer also interrupted me a lot while I was writing an initial solution and that threw me off - I like to be more iterative in my problem solving but I think he expected 100% immediate correctness.He had an observer there too and that guy looked bored out of his mind and that bugged me a little too as it wasn't clear who would be doing the judging.4) I was also handed some hard to read Python code (I don't know Python) and asked to figure out what it does. I did OK on this - but again surprised to be handed hard-to-read code in a language I didn't know.5) One final question ""How would you implement the ""ls"" Unix function in your language of choice. It should take the input:>ls a/b/c/*/e/*/f/*/*/gand the output should be similar the the output given by unix.""I used a tree structure to represent the file directory structure and wrote a solution from there. I did OK on this.Overall: Everyone seemed very nice - I had a nice lunch and the campus is interesting but it was clear that what I studied was not what I needed to (so lesson learned: don't just trust the distribution of questions on Glassdoor or CareerCup). I even got to walk past Zuckerberg's office (more of a conference room) and saw Sheryl Sandberg in there.One interesting thing I learned is a lot of Google people are leaving for Facebook. Also I'd say if you are over 30 (I am 41) you are a rare bird at Facebook :-)I knew based on the reactions of the interviewers that it was very probably a bust, but overall a good experience and something I will learn from.

He explained the hiring process, asked me about myself and what I did/do.Then, a week later, I had technical phone interview with a FB employee. We had a session in Google Docs set up. She first asked me about myself a little and asked one technical question. I had to write C/C++ code in Google Docs while explaining what I do on the phone.It was quite hard actually. Not even the question itself but the whole experience, you feel bad if you make a typo (and i did many silly typos that I usually do not make when writing code), because she can see your typing in real time. Also, you cannot debug or anything.. In the end, to understand my idea of a solution, she gave me an example input and asked to traverse it using my code. After getting an idea she said, ok, almost correct, you could find a bug in 10 mins, ya, but we gotta end now.Next day the original recruiter emailed me saying that they wouldn't take me.

I'll admit to having somewhat of an off-day at the on-site. I completely fumbled the ""are there any bugs in your code"" question with at least one of the interviewers; I said there wasn't, but there was a pretty obvious bug once he described the failure mode to me.There was a scheduling mix-up with at least one of my interviewers, which caused my time with him to be cut short. I'm sure that didn't help with him getting a good feel for me for the sake of his interview feedback.The culture seems a bit more corporatey than the recruiting buzz might put forward; it seems geared toward people who want to have one foot in the startup pond while having the other firmly planted on the dry land of large, relatively safe organization. There are a lot of small teams, and the reflection I got is that there is a non-negligible amount of bureaucracy weighing on the organization. I guess when you get to 1000 people, that will happen.The office space is a mostly open floor plan, and the gear the developers are provided to work on is really good stuff.But that's an initial impression, and things are not always as they appear.So yeah, weirdness in the interview scheduling and such dragged down my impression, but I'd probably give the dice another roll if the chance comes up again.

I had three interviews - the first went very well, the second was terrible, the third was alright. The terrible interviewer asked some basic technical questions involving writing code on the board. As I thought out loud, I asked the interviewer clarification questions and then ultimately asked whether I should start writing code on the board. The interviewer either did not respond to my questions or mumbled off a few incomprehensible words. I started writing code and as soon as I stepped back from the board, the interviewer pointed out my mistake without giving me a chance to assess the code myself. He did this an another two times for the subsequent questions.Overall, the questions were not difficult at all. It seems that Facebook wants to make sure that you code frequently enough that you do not make any errors on your first hack at a problem. This seems to fit the ""go fast and break things"" motto.

The question was fairly straight-forward (multiply two very large numbers given as Strings) and the interviewer wasn't looking for any tricks or anything like that to solve. Like others have mentioned, quick clean code seems to be the key. Unfortunately, the interviewer had a very thick East Asian accent and talking over the phone just made things worse. I had to ask him to repeat quite a few times. It was probably me but at times I couldn't even tell when he'd asked a question because of the inflection! It must've gone well enough though because I got an on-site call.The on-site was two interviews of 45 min each. In the first one, I took a bit of a hit because a) I couldn't see the solution right away b) it took me a while to get up to speed and code the thing - I did manage to finish it though and it seemed (relatively) bug-free. Again, as lots of people have mentioned, the interviewer seemed quite young, just a year or so out of school and he didn't offer much in terms of feedback - positive or negative - as the interview progressed. Once he'd given me the question and given me the hint that got me started, he was busy with his iPhone, rarely looking up. That kinda sucked.The second interviewer was much nicer - probably one of the best ones I've interviewed with - lots of feedback, lots of encouragement, was accepting of different trains of thought and non-standard answers. Seemed like a really nice guy too.Overall, it seems to be the case with Facebook thata) Your interview really depends on who you getb) They seem to value quick-clean-bug free-optimized code at the first try more than anything elsec) Questions are of average to above-average difficulty (if you've prepared!)",Write a function to take a BST and a value k as input and have it print the kth smallest element in the BST.   5 Answers

Overall it was a good experience but I did not get the offer as they are looking for people who can code in like 10 mins as I was able to code in 15-20 mins. They want bug free code and will only go forward with the best candidate. I think even if you do a minor mistake you are out as there is someone else who will solve it perfectly so try to solve it perfectly :)Another important lesson is if you get option of phone v/s in person interview, I will say go for in person interview as it gives the interviewer the chance to see what you are doing on paper verses imagining that over phone.",serialize and serialize a BST   1 Answer

Was quite drawn out due to personal circumstances. Interviewed from Australia, initially a phone screening interview (5 fairly basic iOS questions, understanding blocks and ARC), followed by 2 technical phone interviews (algorithmic coding questions plus verbal conversations around past work experience and also technical iOS questions.After passing in these two phone interviews they flew me out to Menlo Park for a day of interviews. There were 5 interviews, one initial chat to warm up, talking about past experience, working relationships, etc, and a brief coding question on the whiteboard.There were 3 more technical interviews of same format as the initial phone interviews. Plus one interview on designing scalable iOS app architecture for a simple app.I really enjoyed the process and found the recruiters very helpful and friendly. Going and visiting Facebook HQ was great and as the reviews say all the people were great. Recommend doing for the experience. Getting an offer is tough. For me it came down to not being quick enough in answering the questions in the onsite technical interviews. They weren't overly difficult but they want you to move fast, and I tended to take my time and discuss with the interviewers which I believe worked against me. The other aspect was a general lack of experience (I have 18 months experience), and this reflected especially in the iOS design interview.Hope this helps others considering going through the process!

Facebook,"Feb 26, 2015",No Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,I applied through a recruiter. The process took 3 weeks. I interviewed at Facebook.,"I didn't end up getting an offer.Due to NDA I cannot explicitly write down the questions, but look at the last 150 questions in Glassdoor and CareerCup and you'll do fine (I did fine in the coding rounds, get to that in a bit).Usual advice: Do a lot of white-boarding for questions and be ready to talk extensively about your projects and architecture and design.Screening Round:I applied to Facebook by getting connected to a recruiter through a colleague and friend. The process started in Seattle and I opted for a in-person onsite interview for the screening round (they have this option for locals in Seattle/California).The interview went well i.e. I figured out how to solve the question in optimal time and space complexity. I made some mistakes here and there while writing the solution down but the interviewer didn't seem to mind. Contrary to what I had heard, he wasn't too anal about syntax (also helped that I write in C# he wasn't very familiar with it)Onsite Round:I received an email from the recruiter that they wanted to move forward and call me onsite. I was like, cool!I took around 2 weeks to prepare and also tried to do design questions. I felt a bit under prepared around design and tried to make up for it in the last few weeks by watching videos around cloud architecture (and open source stuff like Hadoop, Kafka and Storm).Onsite was pretty straightforward. First round was a career fit/discussion and I did pretty well (I think). It was mainly some behavioral questions and a lot diagrams around the architecture in my current and previous projects.Second round was the one that I messed up.The question was around designing an existing Facebook feature (as a hint, think about the various add-dons you see on FB and instagram like Chat, Search, latest friend related news or popular links). When you really dig into designing this feature, its quite complicated and requires a reasonable amount of knowledge around distributed data storage etc. etc.You need to nail this round to get into Facebook (in my personal opinion). I'm guessing they will adjust their expectations based on your years of experience.There was a lunch which was informal and two more coding rounds where they asked questions that were very similar to the ones I had practiced. I made some silly mistakes here and there but again (due to practice) came up with optimal time/space complexity answers.Got my result exactly one week from the my onsite date. No offer.

I wasn't planning on applying to Facebook, but a recruiter reached out to me mid-december on LinkedIn. I thought ""what the heck, it's a great company"" and got back to her the next day, but she was leaving for the XMas break. No more communication until early Jan. Connecting on the phone was a pain, as first she didn't call until 15 minutes after she said she would. I had stopped standing by the phone and went to email her when she did call, so missed it. We emailed and set something up for an hour later. This time she called 30 minutes late. No apologies or anything. Sigh. She advised that I put all of my other interviews before the Facebook one so that I could get practice, and then signed me up for a free interview review course they run. I went and things were all great, so I told them I was ready. Queue another 2 week pause while they tried to answer a question I had asked before scheduling me. When I finally made it onsite for an interview (mid-late feb), I had expected it to be a full day of interviewing, but instead it was a 30 minute screen before I could do the *actual* interview. In all fairness, I should have seen that coming. But anyways, did the screen and got a response before I had even left the parking that they wanted to schedule my full interview. I also got a call from my recruiter that afternoon to give me interview feedback. I thought that was awesome, as most people don't do that. I can't say how useful it was as I had no negative feedback from my interviewers and her advice was just ""wow, keep doing whatever you just did!"" but it sounds like it could be useful if things don't go perfectly the first time around. Anywho, by this time I had multiple other offers with deadlines on them. I went ahead and scheduled the final round interview for the following week, but ended up canceling the day before as I had decided to go with another company. This seemed to irk my recruiter, despite the fact that she was the one who told me to interview with other companies first and I had been upfront about that and the associated timelines during the whole process. When initial contact and end offer are 2.5 months apart, you can't expect someone to be sitting idle that whole time...The only reason I still rank this as a positive experience is because I had a secondary recruiter I worked with coordinating onsite logistics (the girl who first contacted me was out of state) and he was awesome.

I interviewed at Facebook.,"I was contacted by a recruiter, I came onsite for an initial screen.I thought the interviewer was very nice, and the question was reasonable. However, the frustrating part for me was that for the given question, there were a few different ways to solve it.From my perspective, it seemed that the approach I used to solve the question was not what the interviewer had in mind. I understand that you should listen to an interviewer when they interrupt you or give you hints, but to me it seemed like the ""hints"" were basically from the perspective of ""you're not solving this the way I would solve it, even though both of our solutions are O(n)"".The result was that I was basically having to write out a problem on a white board and constantly have my train of thought interrupted. The interruptions were unnecessary, and I had to clarify to the interviewer that my intent would indeed work. Example interruption:Interviewer: ""That array index is giving you the same result as the other value""Me: ""No, that's a different variable name""Interviewer: ""Oh, oops. Continue""orInterviewer: ""Wait, why are you replacing the for loop with a while loop?""Me: ""Because I want to be able to manipulate the cursor directly""Interviewer: ""Oh, ok. Continue""In the above statement, it's clear that the usual method of solving the problem did not involve a while loop (but it could be done to solve the problem). After my solution, the interviewer explained the most straightforward solution to the problem which basically leveraged the constraints of the problem itself, and after seeing that then of course the problem was trivial to implement.So to me, it seemed like the question was more of a riddle than a coding exercise, which I believe to be a bad interview question, and at my current company it's accepted as the WORST type of interview question.It was rather embarrassing for me to be turned down, especially on just the initial screen, but another qualm I had was that screens are generally meant to filter out candidates that can't code at all, not candidates who are questionable in their skills (from my perspective my skills aren't questionable, but clearly I did not give my best performance in this screen).To me it felt as though the interviewer in this case did not have much experience. While I was answering the questions that were given to me, I was having to explain a few quirks to the python language that the interviewer clearly did not know i.e. ""Oh, I didn't know you could compare dictionaries like that"". For that to be said, I can only infer that the ONLY thing this interviewer was looking for is if I answer the question that was given to me in the exact way they wanted it solved.",Basically an array manipulation problem   Answer Question

Contrary to what most people have said, I got an interviewer who wasn't very friendly. He was there to do his job. Plain and simple."," Before I get to the question I just want to say that the interviewer had a very thick accent (I'm an international candidate, BTW), and that made it really difficult for me to understand what he wanted me to do. This isn't me being bitter. I'm saying this so that I present a very honest opinion about my interview.That being said, the question wasn't something that can be found online or in most books, I was given 2 functions String recv() and String ReadLine() [ both these DO NOT take arguments]. recv() generates some string (Example:""123\n45\n6789""). ReadLine() should read the string being returned by recv() and print all characters until the first \n. After that it should read the recv() string again and print the next characters until the 2nd \n.Example: recv(): ""123\n45\n6789""               ReadLine(): ""123"" //first call of ReadLine               ReadLine(): ""45"" // second call of ReadLineHowever, the next sequence now doesn't have a \n. So, once the end of the string is hit, the ReadLine() function must call recv() again, and append all characters until it reads a \n.Continuing the above example: ReadLine():6789abcde //Third call of ReadLine                                                  recv():""abc""// still no \n...so you must call recv() again                                                  recv():""de\n""The commented sections are my explanations (the interviewer didn't give any such things).

He asked the standard screening questions and set up a technical phone screen for later that week.The phone screen was done using coderpad.io, and they threw me off from the very beginning by setting up a C++ environment although I had told the recruiter that I was most comfortable in Python and although I never claimed anywhere that I had any familiarity with C++. Still, interview questions tend to be general enough that, as long as you aren't completely unfamiliar with the language syntax, you can generally do a decent job in any language. So off we went in C++.The interviewer was very pleasant, and even gave me some tips for how to improve my resume at the beginning. Then we dived into the coding.

Unlike Google (interviewed with them also), Facebook seems to have a smaller question pool as one of the system design questions I got I've also seen on Glassdoor before.I recommend going through the information recruiters provide for interview preparation. Since Google and Facebook use very similar processes, ""Stevey's Blog Rants: Get that job at Google"" post is also quite relevant and useful. Know your data-structures, algorithms, practice solving problems for a few weeks and you should be in good shape.For system design questions, you will be asked to design Facebook-scale systems.

I interviewed at Facebook (Seattle, WA) in July 2015.","If you're a solid developer with years of experience working on high visibility products used by millions of people (and references to back it up) don't expect the interview process at Facebook to just work. It really comes down to how much you prepare yourself mentally to code within the context of an interview, and how much you study Career Cups as well as the other resources given to you by the recruiter. Sadly, you don't have to be a great developer at all.What's interesting is that none of these skills have been necessary during my 17 years of real world experience. I never had to write code on a whiteboard (except for other interviews) and I don't see how ""writing code fast"" should be considered a measurement of someone's productivity and code quality. That sort of thinking seems naive and haphazard to me.What frightens me is that I think Facebook truly believes they're ""raising the bar"" with this system. But they're not always hiring good people, and they're probably turning down a lot of great folks.The coding tests were super easy. Two were questions I've actually asked myself while conducting interviews for another company which was aimed towards entry level developers. I really wish they would have asked more challenging questions. I was able to finish them before the end of each panel, and with optimal solution.The design question they gave me actually aligned with something I developed and designed for a product used by millions. I felt good with how everything went at the end of the day, but somehow I failed at *both* coding and design. Interesting... whatever.Two of my friends--whom of which I mentored at my last company--were able to get offers at Facebook (same office, same interview process) but they were *not* the best coders nor the top performers, so if you get turned down at Facebook, don't take it seriously. They say there is some ""randomness"" in the interview, but it just seems strange that common sense didn't kick anywhere to question the obvious, or just the fact I was interviewed by a few people with only 5 years experience. Smart, but inexperienced (and somewhat arrogant) wanting to judge you with entry level coding questions.Half of the people that interviewed me didn't go through the interview process themselves. They were brought in by acquisitions. Specifically for a product that isn't doing very well right now.I was excited about the idea of working there initially, but after the interview, I wasn't so sure anyway. They do try to put a lot of emphasis on finding great developers, but many of the folks who interviewed me mentioned the codebase was a mess (probably from writing code so quickly and not thinking through it) And their open office (no cubes, no walls, just wires and computers everywhere) is a bit distracting. Not something genuinely appreciated by the people working there who used to have their own office. When you need to focus and get quality work done, there are only so many dedicated rooms to use and they're usually taken.Coupled with the fact that they're Seattle office is located in one of the worst traffic areas, I wasn't so sure I would have accepted anyway.",Signed an NDA but just check the resources given to you by the recruiter   Answer Question

I interviewed at Facebook (Menlo Park, CA) in June 2015.","I started off with a standard technical phone screen with a Facebook engineer. It was a simple coding exercise with two questions of surprisingly low difficulty. I cleared this easily.Facebook's on-site interview process is far more rigorous, though. Each 45-min interview has a clearly defined role, intended to test you from multiple different angles. Specifically, I went through:- 2 ""Ninja"" interviews (coding & algorithms)- 2 ""Pirate"" interviews (system design)- 1 ""Jedi"" interview (behavioral & simple coding)plus lunch with a Facebook engineer.The ""Ninja"" and ""Jedi"" interviews were straightforward. I hadn't seen the coding questions before, but they were not particularly hard. I would rate them as being of just average difficulty, pretty similar to the whiteboard coding questions asked at most other major Silicon Valley tech companies. And the behavioral section of the ""Jedi"" interview was just a friendly chat about my resume and my past experiences.However, the ""Pirate"" interviews were what killed me. Both ""Pirate"" interviews involved being asked to propose and discuss a design for existing features on Facebook. The interviewers were extremely meticulous and questioned me on virtually every last detail of my design decisions. In particular, they focused a lot on how huge datasets should be stored and accessed to support extremely large-scale distributed systems. Even though I am already working on web-scale systems in my current job, I was nonetheless still way under-prepared for this level of technical challenge and scrutiny.My advice to all prospective candidates is to spend most of your time preparing for the ""Pirate"" interviews. The coding questions aren't hard, but the system design questions will likely stretch you to your limit! (Unless you're a fresh grad--they don't ask ""Pirate"" questions to fresh grads. Lucky folks!)Additional side note: interestingly, my Facebook recruiter actually gave me detailed post-mortem feedback on each and every one of my interviews. They are the only major Silicon Valley company I know that does this, so major kudos to them for being so considerate."," Can't disclose due to NDA.

After the initial chat with the recruiter to chat about FB, my interests and logistics, I got scheduled for the initial 45-minute screening. I was given two options for the screen, either phone/codeshare or an onsite visit (likely an option available for local candidates only). I chose the in-person option, and got an invite for a round of full day (5 total) within few hours after the initial screen.Facebook recruiters send interview prep materials to the candidates on what to expect, what to brush up on, as well as some suggestions tailored to a particular candidate's weak-ish spots (in my case it was the speed of coding). I knew what to expect going in and felt well prepared on this front.Initial screen was algorithm + coding. Nothing overly challenging.Onsite consisted of 5 interviews (+ informal lunch) covering:1) One ""Jedi"" interview with a hiring manager testing behavior / culture fit + warm-up coding. Prepare to talk about past experience, career goals, as well as several ""tell me about the time when..."" questions.2) One ""Pirate"" interview: System design portion of the interview. There are great resources on Quora on suggestions on how to prepare and what to pay attention too.3) Three ""Ninja"" interviews focusing on algorithm + coding. I actually have seen all of the questions I got asked at Facebook before, but that did not help me as ultimately the reason for rejection was cited as not being able to come up with optimal solutions and code fast enough.Got an phone call from the recruiter in about a week+few days after the interview telling me the unfortunate news. I think I had to wait few extra days because of the July holidays and typically the process is faster.Culture: I did find some of the junior Facebook engineers conducting my interview a bit arrogant and cocky, but nothing too alarming.All in all, I had a positive interview experience. I wish the interview loop was better tailored towards someone more senior, e.g. less emphasis on coding, more on design. Current interview process makes it seem they hire code monkeys."," I can't discuss specifics due to NDA, but interview questions were neither overly difficult nor tricky.

Not sure what is so special about those rounds or whether they were even part of the decision making. Interviewers were happy with the answers and not much corrections.Then there were these design rounds. One of the rounds was about designing location services. The interviewer was very knowledgeable. Pointed out my in-efficiencies with the choice of data-structure. Enjoyed it.Then started the real fun in the final round. An awesome interviewer with an awesome attitude. He spoiled my interview experience though. Asked me to design a messaging app system. Once the interviewer breaks the comfort zone, it would be a difficult place to stand. His expressions were horrible and sometimes I felt like saying ""shut-up and listen first"" which I didn't say obviously. When I mentioned that the server knows the ip address of client only when the server receives a packet from client. He said, there are a lot other ways it happens. I mentioned the only way is clients packet to the server. He made it an argument and finally I had to ask him to mention a way.

There in lies the problem, i,e. questions are not challenging. I answered all questions, with efficient solutions. There was no indication what so ever from the interviewer if there was anything wrong in my solutions. However, I'm guessing that since I couldn't finish in time to run through couple of examples, I got rejected. They don't give any grace period, if there's no time left, they end it abruptly. I guess they want to be fair to everyone. There was absolutely no feedback from any of the interviewers during the process, so it's hard understand what are they looking for, if anything is going wrong. This is true for the system-design as well.In my case looks like the decision was already made before lunch, the last round interviewers seemed completely un-interested. One of them was on the laptop typing continuously while I was presenting my solution.I'm sure they are able to find people who are able to code the solution in time. In my opinion, for most, this is only possible if you have already coded same or similar problem. There are tons of websites that lists the questions.

Surprisingly recruiter asked me a technical question, it was not hard (Fibonacci function and its optimizations), but it was unexpected. Anyway I answered her question in details (bottom up solution, top down, DP) and she replied that it's exactly what she expected to hear.Since I'm local to Bay Area I had an opportunity to have 1:1 onsite screen instead of phone screen. I choose that option and we arranged the interview in a week. Onsite screen was good, the interviewer was very nice and friendly, he was very helpful during the interview and there was an impression that we wanted to see my process of thinking. Eventually I solved the problem that was average difficulty. I started with brute force and then optimized it. In 2 days I got a call from the recruiter, she told I did well and we scheduled onsite interview.There were 5 interview for onsite: whiteboard programming -> whiteboard programming -> resume discussion with coding -> architecture discussion -> whiteboard programming. The problems were average difficulty. I was kind of slow on the first and last coding, I think it was expected to solve a couple of problems instead of one. All interviewers were very friendly and helpful, at the end all of them shared that I solved the problem correctly and in an efficient way and that it was OK that we solved only one problem.I already wanted to say that regardless the result my experience was positive, but after the interview I got a pretty bad experience. I didn't have any response or feedback for 2 weeks after the interview. I expected the rejection, but the silence in the first week gave me some hope that they are thinking about me (I was slow on the interview, but I didn't fail it completely).

Facebook,"Oct 30, 2015",No Offer,Positive Experience,Easy Interview,"I applied online. The process took 2 weeks. I interviewed at Facebook (Menlo Park, CA) in September 2015.","I am an experienced engineer. My phone interview was pretty standard. I got through 2 coding questions, and had a great chat with the interviewer. I was called onsite shortly.Onsite I had 5 modules. 3 ""ninja modules"", which are coding based, 1 ""jedi module"" which is behavioral/resume/experience and a small coding problem, and 1 ""pirate module"", which is system design. I've done interviews with Google and LinkedIn as well (and got offers from both), and the coding problems at Facebook were actually the simplest. I smashed all the coding interviews. The Jedi interview was pretty good too.The place where I failed was the pirate module. If you are interviewing with FB, I cannot stress enough that you really really need to prep system design. I actually failed my design interview spectacularly (they asked me to design a popular feature on FB). But based on my other performances, they decided to call me back the next week for another system design interview. Well, I failed that one too, LOL. Yes, apparently I was that bad at system design.It is strange, because at Google I was specifically told that the system design interview was used to ""slot"" a software engineer only (senior, staff, etc.). i.e. it was not a dealbreaker. For FB, apparently it is a dealbreaker. Personally I think every one has certain strengths and weaknesses. I readily admit that my weakness is system design. My strength is algorithms and coding, and I've actually done pretty well in competitive programming as well. But FB really would prefer to see someone who knows a decent amount about everything, rather than be really good at one thing (algorithms and coding) and not great at another (system design).As far as the interviewers go, they were an amazing bunch. Even when I was bombing the system design module, the interviewer was very respectful, encouraging, and friendly. I walked away with a very positive experience. Everyone was excited to be working there, and I can see that it is a terrific place!If you are interviewing there, my advice is to really read up on many many open source architectures, and thoroughly understand system design.

Facebook,"Feb 2, 2016",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,I applied online. The process took 2 weeks. I interviewed at Facebook.,"I attended Facebook's University Day, where they had about 20 university students who were there for interviews. The day starts off with the interview itself, then you spend about 5 hours touring the Facebook campus and learning more about Facebook. When the interview process began, all of us were siting in a room and interviewers would come in and call our names. I watched as interviewer after interviewer came in with cheerful looks on their faces and called out names of other students. After about 5 minutes, my interviewer came in and called me. He was a heavy set man, dressed sloppy, and had a look on his face like he didn't want to be there. I could tell right away that it would not go well. When we entered the interview room, he immediately began asking technical questions. He didn't ask any questions about me to get to know me, and after asking other students that were there, they all began with a talk about their backgrounds. During the entire interview, I had the impression that my interviewer just wanted to rush me through so he could go on to do something else. He asked me 2 questions, one which went well and a second where I had a bit of trouble. My recruiter had told me beforehand that if we got stuck on a question, our interviewer would make an effort to get us back on track by offering hints. My interviewer did no such thing. I even told him what I was trying to do, and why I was getting stuck, implying that I could use a hint. He just sat there without saying anything. Finally after I wasted about 10 minutes trying different ways to solve it, he tells me that we're running out of time and hurries me through the rest of the problem. He gave me the last 5 minutes to ask him questions. Since I had a feeling that he was being forced to be there, one of my questions was if Facebook employees have dedicated interviewers, or if random employees are selected to be interviewers from time to time. He said it was the latter. So of course I knew that he was being forced to be there and he just wanted it to end. After the interview was over, he walked me back to meet the other students. By this time I already knew he wasn't going to give me a good review, but Facebook doesn't all you to go home at this point. You're forced to spend 5 hours learning about how wonderful it is to work at Facebook so that you know about all the good things you just missed out on.

He didn't even comment anything about my experience, felt as if he is just following the protocol to get done with the interview.He asked me 1st question, I was able to solve it in 20 mins with optimal solution. Although no comment here from him whether as per him it is okay or not. Neither he asked me the run time complexity of the solution which was O(n).He then just jumped to another question. I took remaining of my time trying to get to the proper solution, but I think I was in the right direction b'coz I researched about that question after the interview.After couple of days I get a phone call from HR saying the feedback was not +ve.

Since I live in the area I opted to do it in person at the Menlo Park facility. The recruiter supplied me with links to several sources of preparation materials, and asked for dates which I might be ready for my first technical interview. I opted for a date two weeks from the phone screening.On the day of the interview I was greeted at Facebook by the recruiter, who showed me around the campus, which consists of 16+ buildings and has lots of amenities. The recruiter brought me to a small meeting room with two whiteboards and a few minutes later the interviewer showed up, accompanied by an observer. The first thing they did was ask me about any current projects I'm working on, and about the tech stack I use. After talking about that for a few minutes they presented me with a coding problem, which I could do in a language of my choice.I have not done many of the typical coding challenge problems you might see on LeetCode or similar sites. I was relying on experience and my ability to work through a problem. I read somewhere that interviewers care more about how you approach a problem than how well you can churn out memorized material, so I thought I'd be better off focusing on my overall approach and communication skills. In that regard I think I did well but after reading some other reviews, perhaps I worked too slowly and could have benefitted from doing more of those more academic coding exercises. I was given one problem and took the whole 45ish minutes to do it. I started with a very general conceptual solution done visually, and then wrote it up as executable code, while addressing bug and ways it could be made more efficient. Afterwards I was asked to execute the solution on the whiteboard as if I were an interpreter running the code, noting intermediate values and output.I did not find the problem very difficult but I wanted to make sure I stayed engaged with the interviewer and talk out the solution while working on it, which is not how I typically code on my own."," Do an in-place (without allocating any extra memory) rearrangement of a list of integers, putting non-zero elements first.   5 Answers"

Facebook,"Jun 23, 2017",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. I interviewed at Facebook (Menlo Park, CA) in June 2017.","A recruiter had contacted me in the past, I decided to go ahead with the process now. Had first technical screening interview, I opted to do at Menlo Park office instead of phone. It was purely data structures and algorithms. He gave some hints which I did not take in first go but I did understand and solved the problem, so he gave mixed feedback, I was asked for another screening. Did it again at Menlo Park office. It went very well and I was invited for onsite. During onsite had 4 interviews, 2 coding, 1 behavioral + small code and 1 system design. At the end of system design, the interviewer said Good job. I did pretty well in the coding rounds too, Each coding round, I could solve two problems which is a good sign as per whatever I had heard from friends. But, I did end up getting rejected. Well, rejection is a part of interview process but the frustrating part was the feedback. Recruiter said unfortunately we cannot proceed with the offer as your system design did not go well. I was shocked and realized from the other glassdoor reviews I had read that it is the standard response they give because it is an open ended question. My coding rounds went very good so she couldn't say those were the bad ones. I told the recruiter that it is contradictory to what happened and she had nothing to say except for - we will ask our engineers to not give any verbal feedback. What the hell!!!

Facebook,"Jun 22, 2017",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. I interviewed at Facebook (New York, NY) in June 2017.","Was contacted by a Facebook recruiter on Linked In for my expertise in Android. We conversed on and off over a few weeks as I am on business travel a lot, and he was able to setup a phone-based technical interview for me that met my scheduling needs. This recruiter was incredibly professional and interpersonal, provided plenty of prep resources, and made me feel like he was really rooting for me. Awesome!Technical phone interview went poorly. The interviewer introduced himself and immediately asked me a very vague Android question. I feel that I handled my responses very well in an attempt to narrow down what he may be fishing for while demonstrating myself to be adept with Android. Yet I was given very little positive feedback, and he seemed to ask the same question several more times. Apparently, I have no clue what he was asking. At this point, I felt like an item on his to-do list.He denied the compile and run time capabilities of coderpad, making for a much more theoretical text-only based environment. So the solution would have to be proven to work via tracing it, which wastes time and renders coderpad pointless in my opinion.It was difficult enough for me to understand the thick accent that it turned me off to asking clarifying questions during the coding problem. Instead, I felt that I had to voice every thought, which did not allow me to think more deliberately. I became a bit flustered and floundered for a moment, despite the question being relatively simple. I recognized this, and had prepared for it by having a white board at the ready. I requested to have a moment to collect my thoughts and draw on my board quick. I am a visual person and there are things that are just more easily drawn than typed out. He declined, telling me to stick to the editor.At this point, it was game over. Typing my thoughts in the editor was making a mess as I traced my logic over the examples because the cursor was jumping all over. I believe this was because the editor was technically set to Java, and I should have made a comment block around his question and my typing. I also was not allowed to create a runnable Java class to put my code in. So I was cut off before long.I tried to exchange some more pleasantries but he was clearly done. In any case, I had asked him why he chose Facebook and I got a dissatisfying answer. I would gander a guess that he was not nearly as stoked about the mission and impact of Facebook as I am, and I don't even work there!I think I had most of the main working principles and demonstrated that I could code Java, but the solution was not complete. (To be honest, I think I suffered a small panic attack.) It does not matter if you invented a robot that defeats the Turing Test, the technical interviewer may not care to even read your resume and will shut you down if you do not perform flawlessly. With these tech giants, you won't be hired without a perfect performance.The recruiter sent me a canned rejection two days later with no response to my reply. I completely understand and respect the decision to be cutoff. But I feel like it took two to make this a waste of everyone's time."," Balance a string with parentheses.

Facebook,"Sep 8, 2017",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,NAN,"Did a phone screen, then a full-day interview loop, then was asked to do *another* phone screen. I had a great on-site (probably one of the best of my career; I got the correct answer to *every question* with time to spare), but it didn't matter: second phone screen was a disaster. The call was delayed due to a technical problem, the guy barely spoke english, and he was annoyed from the start. I got the DYHQFM early-end-of-interview signal despite writing a correct solution, and was rejected shortly thereafter.Overall, Facebook's interview process is marginally more humane than the other big players, but just as idiotic and random. Solving the problems and correctly writing them on a whiteboard whilst singing and dancing is insufficient -- if you make *any* mistakes, you will fail. If an interviewer is having a bad day, you will fail. If an interviewer doesn't feel like doing interviews today, you will fail. If someone feels like failing you because you're too old or not wearing a hoodie or they don't like your voice, you will fail.The recruiters will tell you all sorts of nonsense about how people are looking for ""how you think"" and that they understand that candidates are nervous and blah, blah blah...these are lies. It's random, and it's biased strongly toward failure. You're probably going to fail, regardless of performance. Basically, if you're demonstrably a really good engineer, flip a coin seven times. If you get all heads, you get a job. Otherwise, you fail.I'm tired of hearing Facebook complain about not being able to find qualified people.

We then started the questions and got through about 1.5 of them. It should have been possible to get through both if I was less nervous.The biggest con to the overall process was the lack of interaction with my interviewer on the on-site interview. I felt he didn't get an accurate sense of my ability as an overall programmer and peer since there was no chance to introduce myself.

I could hear vessels banging and he was talking to someone while I was trying to arrive at a solution. He carelessly responded to my followup questions and cut me off at 40minutes mark in a 45min interview.I did arrive at the solution and code was 95% done before he cut me off. I spoke about different algorithms and issues with them. But he didn't seem to be listening to whatever I said.

Facebook,"Aug 8, 2016",No Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,I applied through a recruiter. I interviewed at Facebook in July 2016.,"I was initially contacted by a recruiter and we had an initial discussion about engineering at Facebook and my interests. I was then scheduled for a phone interview.The phone interview was with an Engineer and he asked 2 pretty standard coding questions, nothing crazy. After the phone interview, I was invited onsite.The onsite interview consisted of 5 sessions:* A discussion with the interviewer about my past experience and how I reacted to certain situations (""tell me about a time when"" type questions) and a coding question* 3 coding sessions* A system design sessionI also had lunch with an Engineer and was able to ask additional questions during lunch. Overall, the sessions were well managed. 2 of the coding sessions involved standard coding questions that can be found on various online resources (leetcode, geeks for geeks, etc). The third was a question that I hadn't seen before and that I found challenging. I ran out of time on this particular session.The system design question was relatively straightforward.The discussion + coding session threw me for a loop. I had a discussion with the interviewer for most of the session about various situations in the past. Suddenly, he said ""ok, we have less than ten minutes left, time to code"". It was a little jarring and I had a little bit of a tough time switching gears so suddenly. The question itself wasn't too difficult, but the sudden change caught me off guard and I had some mistakes in my solution.Overall the interviewers were very nice and respectful. When I had the opportunity to ask questions, it felt like they were hones and sincere in their answers (it didn't feel like unnecessary corporate cheerleading).After my onsite had concluded, I received an email for feedback on the interview, which was nice. They asked for detailed feedback on the interview and whether or not the folks were on time for the sessions. It seems like Facebook takes their interview process and the feedback seriously (from what I can gather).In the end, I was not extended an offer, but the overall process was very efficient and smooth.",NAN

Instead, the whole process felt like an exam, and most interviewers behaved like examiners, not collaborators.There was very little discussion or debate. During 4 coding rounds, the interviewers took a backseat right after they gave me the problem statement. After I was done coding, the interviewers examined my code and stated their objections to it, such as:- There's a wrong variable name that won't let your code compile- Please don't use your own utility functions, I've provided you with a few- Your code doesn't meet my contract exactly (I did implement an optimization, with the verbal agreement that the client didn't need the extra data)- In my system design round, I was asked to scale out a complicated data structure. I did make reasonable progress, but the interviewer and I were playing catch-up for the entire interviewTwo interviewers told me to implement a 'silly' protocol, or a 'silly' class.

The recruiter then notified me they would like to move forward. The process is simple: at first there will be a technical interview for 45 minutes. If you ace that, then there will be another technical interview for 45 minutes. At this moment, if they think they are not sure, they sometimes take another technical interview.For me, it was two interviews (both phone). They were very technical, where you have to write code in coderpad. In both of the interviews, I was asked two questions each (can't disucss the questions here as I've signed an NDA). Both of my interviewers were very friendly, I felt like chatting with my friends and discussing some tricky problems. It was a very nice experience. I also think in addition to your solution, they also care about: (1) your communication skill (interacting with the interviewer); (2) your approach and thought process, i.e., how you arrived at the solution; (3) cleanliness and quality of your written code.Finally, as I am a PhD student, they had to match me with a specific team. So I had an additional team/host matching interview. It was less of an interview, and more of a chat about possible projects in the team that might suit my expertise/skill/interests.

Facebook,"Feb 8, 2018",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"I applied through an employee referral. The process took 1+ week. I interviewed at Facebook (Menlo Park, CA) in January 2018.","Overall, it's an AWESOME experience.My friend referred me to and a recruiter reached out to me within a week on January 18th. They initially scheduled a phone screen on January 23rd but I was told I could skip the phone screen on January 22nd. They did not tell me the reason why but I'm very sure it's because of the strong internal referral from my ex-coworker who is also my good friend.The onsite interview was scheduled for January 30th. The onsite interview was five sessions - Two coding interviews, two career discussion + coding interviews and one system design interview.The system design interview was very interesting. This is my first time doing system design interviews because they are targeting me as E4. The interviewer asked me to design a domain-specific system but I didn't have any specific experience in that field. He was cool with that and he was able to make the question general enough so that I was able to build my solution and show off my system design skills. One master tips for system design interview was to do a mock interview with your friend. The Facebook recruiter also sent out useful information on how to prepare for system design interviews, which was also super helpful.If I have to name one thing I didn't like that much was two career discussion + coding session. It was a little bit too much since the career discussion part took almost 40 minutes so I end up speaking for 80 mins non-stop which was super tiring. Honestly, I think one career discussion + coding session is enough already. There is really no point to having two there. The 5 minutes coding was also a rush that there is no time for me to walk through my code. One of the interviewers said ""you don't have to explain to me"" when I was doing the coding part, which was a head-scratcher. I'm an interviewer as well and the big part of the technical interview is to expect candidates to communicate well.Two coding interviews went well. The first interviewer thought I did too quick and we end up solving three questions in one interview. I don't know if he suspected that I already saw the questions (which I did not) so he had to ask two additional questions. The second interviewer asked a relatively more complex question than the first interviewer but it was just a practical question so as long as you are comfortable with algorithms and data structures, you are good. They apparently were disallowed to ask brain teasers.I also got an additional exploratory chat that I requested with a manager from WhatsApp who walked me out of the MPK 12 building.My recruiter friend touched base with me three days later (February 2nd, Friday) and told me that my overall feedback looks good (sounds intentionally vague) and we are moving to the two approval meetings on next Monday and Tuesday. I was informed that my offer is approved on Tuesday afternoon.My recruiter friend then helped me to schedule calls with different teams' manager. I got very interested in talking with a director in Instagram which I'm a super fan of. After series of phone calls, my recruiter called again and spent an hour to help me get my questions answered. The discussion was very transparent and smooth. We also talked about a lot of topics including career development, team selection, and the offer competition process because by that time I also got an offer from Google.I actually made the final decision before the final offer numbers came out. Of course, I did not tell them my final decision until offer competition was finished because I want to get more if possible. The main factors that drove me to choose Facebook were ...1) The impact drove culture. Note that I do not think this culture would fit everyone but it should fit me very well because I am passionate about impacting and leading people around me. I'm kind of ambitious personality in terms of my career so impactful and competitive working environment is my catalyst.2) The ultimate flexibility of team mobility. Their boot camp program ensures that you are working in a team that you are happy with (at least for mid term) and you are encouraged to switch team if you are unhappy after a certain period of time. They also have a program called HackerMonth (I might misspell) that allows you to try to work in another team for a month every year.3) Great recruiting experience. Choosing between Google and Facebook was VERY hard and one of the factors that drove me towards Facebook was their recruiting experience. The recruiter was super engaging and extremely responsive. She even responded on Sunday night. Recruiting experience might highly depend on the specific recruiter you get, though.I'd definitely recommend engineers who are passionate to build to try Facebook. It's a unique experience that I felt so grateful to have.",Signed NDA   Answer Question

Facebook,"Jul 24, 2018",No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 2 weeks. I interviewed at Facebook (Menlo Park, CA) in April 2018.","Interview consists of 2 stages. First a technical screen stage where you have option to take it over phone or take it in person onsite. Typically an average difficulty level leet code programming question is asked for this round. The tips to succeed in this stage is first to ask for the clarifications as soon as the question is asked, then orally discuss and come up with an optimized solution and only then start coding. DO NOT assume anything and if doing, first discuss it with the interviewer. While coding, keep special attention towards handling all the corner cases and error cases. Once done coding, come up with at least 3 test cases and walk through the code for these test cases. Handling of corner cases has a huge weightage in the interview.Second stage is the series of onsite interviews. Generally there will be 4 interviews 45 mins each. 1 will be system design interview, 1 will be resume deep dive and behavioral and rest 2 will be coding interviews. For coding interviews, again leet code average difficulty level question will be asked and they are evaluated based on how quickly you come up with a solution, how you optimize your approach and eventually come up to most optimized approach, how cleanly you code and how you think of all possible scenarios/test cases while implementing the code. Ideally, you should be done with all of the above within 30-35 mins so you have some time to discuss about your implemented code as well as ask questions to interviewers. For system design interview, a distributed system design question will be asked and you need to discuss in details regarding the system before talking about its design. Interviewer will try to take the discussion in depth in some particular direction, so go with the flow and let him analyze your skills. Be as verbose as possible. Finally the resume deep dive interview will be in depth discussion of projects mentioned on the resume. Be thorough with all the projects, skills mentioned on resume.My interview experience was good. I cleared the technical screen and gave the onsite interviews but did not get an offer. All the interviewers were nice and soft spoken and they made me feel comfortable.

Don't take bathroom breaks unless you really have to because that'll cut into your interview time. The interviewers usually end right on time even with bathroom breaks. Just go during lunch or before the onsite begins. They'll also cut the interview short so you can ask questions in the last 10 min. Don't take too much time thinking of a solution and write as fast as you can so you can finish on time. It's also ideal if you have time to walk over and test your solution at the end. Start writing high up on the board, so you don't run out of space and have to cramp your solution.

Simply, they are not used to hiring engineers from your background and they will set you up to fail the interview, a self fulfilling prophecy.My advice to Facebook is, in general, train well your engineers in regards to unconscious bias and have them certify before allowing them to conduct interviews. In particular, I would add to no let engineers on sponsored visas that have been in the country for only a short time conduct interviews to citizens and permanent (green card) residents as they do not understand yet the race dynamics of the U.S.A.

Facebook,"Apr 10, 2019",No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied online. The process took 1 day. I interviewed at Facebook (Menlo Park, CA).","I had chosen to go onsite for the facebook recruiting process, so I interviewed at the Menlo Park HQ office. For the first fifteen ish minutes their engineer asked me about my background, some interesting problems I had worked on on Android etc.Then he asked me Leetcode medium question based on trees. I'm the sort of person who likes to take the time to understand the problem better, talk about possible approaches and agree on a solution, but in this case the interviewer seemed like he just wanted a solution as quick as possible. I took about 30 minutes to code and to test the edge cases. The code was perfect, and I was figuring out edge cases along the way by testing but the interviewer just kept interrupting me - giving me hints and edge cases and I hated that.He then proceeded to ask me a second question - a variation of a leetcode medium question that can be solved in linear time by using a ""trick"". If you try to normally solve this problem the first time you're not going to solve it optimally or take some time to think about it (which is what happened to me). I told the interviewer the solution and I started to code, but could not finish the problem.Needless to say next day I got a reject.If you're going to do a phone interview at facebook this is what I have noticed (and feedback from friends who went through the same):1) You need to finish Leetcode. There is no better way to say this but they want a monkey who can spit out code. They're really not interested in how you work your way through the problem or optimize it.2) Don't waste time thinking about how to solve the problem. The interviewer will just scribble in their notebook if you do this and flag you for slow coding. Again - spit out leetcode.3) You will either get 2 mediums or 1 easy - 1medium for a phone screen.4) You are responsible for keeping track of time. The interviewer will not rush you but if you go over the 20 minute unofficial limit for leetcode mediums, bye bye.This is not a company that care about how intelligent you are but how fast you can spit out code.",2 Leetcode Mediums   1 Answer
Facebook,"Apr 10, 2019",No Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,I applied through a recruiter. The process took 3 weeks. I interviewed at Facebook in March 2019.,"I was reached out to by a recruiter asking if I was interested in sending over my resume/interviewing with Facebook. Within an hour of e-mails I had my first phone interview scheduled. It was scheduled for only about 45 minutes, about 30-35 of that reserved for programming problems. The problems were done with coderpad while on the phone, speaking to the interviewer. The first interviewer was really polite and sounded excited about the interview. As with any programming interview, I spoke out loud my thought process and the interviewer was interacting a lot with me along the way, it made me feel much more positive and made me forget about any lingering anxiety. After the weekend I learned I had made it to the second round of phone interviews. This interviewer sounded much less excited, I really got the vibe that they didn't want to be doing this. Where the first interviewer would interact with me, this one was almost a brick wall, and let me waste 5 minutes of our conversation looking for bugs (there was one in my code, the other ""bug"" was due to their lack of knowledge in my chosen language). At the end, we ran out of time and I didn't get to ask many questions.

I interviewed at Facebook (New York, NY) in March 2019.","I applied through a friend’s referral at the nyc office.First was the phone interview. Coding on a shared document. Tough graph question. Had some trouble and had to ask for a hint at one point but eventually got the correct solution. Heard back a couple days later they were going to bring me on-site.On-site was a week and a half later and had two coding interviews, lunch, then a behavioral interview with coding second half, then systems design interview.First coding interview: first problem went very smoothly. Medium level problem involving using a stack. Of course asking clarifying questions first. Second problem was a tree traversal problem. I just could not come up with the “intended” optimal solution.. ended up having to go with the “dumb” solution which I believe still had the same order of time and space complexity anyway, but was a bit ugly.Second coding interview: this interview has easy coding problems.. I think maybe they were testing to see my communication and absolute code perfection over intelligent solutions here? First problem was a personal finance problem to calculate tax owed given income and tax brackets . Second problem was to, given a blank NYT crossword puzzle, output where the “clues” would be (i.e. where does “1 across” start and how long is it etc.)Lunch was lunchBehavioral: didnt prep too much but i came across as authentic because of it. I don’t know if there’s really a good way to prep for this. Soft skills come with time. One question I literally said “i don’t really find myself in those situations at work” which was fine I guess. The coding part of this interview was actually pretty rocky. Had to add two binary numbers (represented as strings I.e. “10110”). I believe this was also just to test communication and thought process.Systems design: problem was design a simple version of Instagram which allows users to see Friends’ images in a feed and also go to friends’ accounts to get that persons images. To prep, look at the material the recruiter will give you. They gave me a GitHub link with a bunch of practice systems design questions and example solutions. Just learn what “kind” of solution they are looking for and that will get you halfway there. (They want boxes and arrows representing the different components and how they interact). I only prepped for systems design the night before and was fine.

About a week after that the recruiter told me I was going to be interviewed. He also included a bunch of URLs to read so I would be familiar with the Facebook interview style.The interview was setup by a coordinator. Two days later the interview took place over the phone.The interviewer introduced himself and asked me to introduce myself by discussing my favorite project. He said my resume was too extensive to discuss. I worked in Silicon Valley for 5 years and have a significant background in software engineering. There was no discussion of the Kaggle competition.He then presented a puzzle. It involved a grid with the letters X, O, and G. X were walls, O were rooms, and G were guards. I had to create an algorithm that computed the the shortest path to each room from a guard. So if it took a guard 3 steps to reach a room, and another guard 2 steps, then you would only keep the 2. The grid was variable size (N x N).The task was to design the algorithm and then code it up in a shared web page. I had about 35 minutes to complete the puzzle.I wasn't able to get it completed. The next day I thought about it while eating lunch and the best way to solve it became clear. I was definitely on the right track during the interview, but it was simply incomplete.The puzzle itself wasn't amazingly hard. It's just the time constraints. I needed another 20 minutes or so to get it done right.A few days later I was told my background was not what they were looking for. This was a really strange thing to say because my background was never discussed. There is no doubt in my mind that my background is strong enough to work at facebook. As a matter of fact, after seeing the skills of the interviewing engineer (I looked him up on LinkedIn), I feel I'm over qualified.A few observations...This was the first time I've been interviewed by someone with significantly less experience than myself.Your past experience is irrelevant. I could have helped Steve Jobs invent the iphone but if you can't solve the puzzle then you'll be passed over.While I was working on the puzzle the interviewer gave me a ""tip"". It turns out that the tip was incorrect. I'm 100% positive that using an efficient solution is completely incompatible with the tip he gave me. Maybe it was part of the test.If you're good at puzzles and have a solid understand of software development, but not a lot of experience, then you should go apply.My personal impression is that they're looking for younger less experienced people.

Facebook,"Jul 22, 2012",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,I applied through a recruiter. The process took 2+ months. I interviewed at Facebook (Bengaluru (India)) in April 2012.,"I was contacted by a recruiting agency for software engineering position at Facebook, and after I told them I was willing to apply, my resume was forwarded to Facebook's recruiter. Next day, I got an email from the FB recruiter with a link to an online coding test on interviewstreet. This test was for one hour duration, designed to test coding skills of the interviewer. It was a string parsing problem and code could be written in any language and we'd just need to submit the output on a given input set. I got an email later from the Facebook people that I passed that test and would need to do a phone interview. My phone interview was scheduled in a week.              An engineer called me up for the phone interview and asked about my work projects. I explained to him briefly and also got to know a little about his work at Facebook. He then followed onto the technical interviewing part and posed a problem for me. We were working on a shared document for this part. This was a problem about the classic binary search tree data structure, like an RB Tree. I coded a simple solution and I was asked to analyse its runtime complexity. I analysed the complexity and was able to put it in Big O notation. He was satisfied with that solution and then moved onto talking about his work, what Facebook is expecting from the candidates and such. The conversation quickly ended after that . A couple weeks later, their recruiter informed me that I passed the phone interview and would be scheduled personal interviews.            About a month after my phone interview, it was the day for the personal interviews and I was flown into their interviewing location. I had two technical interviews that day and another general, informal get-to-know-you-and-your-work type of interview. For technical interviews, code was to be written on a whiteboard. In one of the technical interviews, I was told to come up with an algorithm for a variation of the classic knapsack problem. This could be solved with a dynamic programming and I coded the same on the whiteboard. It's important to explain how the solution was arrived at. After coding it up, I was asked to analyse its complexity. I'd written a recursive solution and I could only write a recurrence relation for the complexity function, not a closed form. I also told him that an interative solution is also possible and wrote it out too. Being an iterative code, with a simple nested loop, it was also easy to analyse its complexity. The interviewer was actually ok with the recurrence relation for the complexity and didn't bug me on an exact form. He seemed satisfied with my solution and then we moved onto general topics. Interview was quickly over after that.            For the second technical interview, I was asked a problem on balanced binary search trees. I'd previously implemented an RB Tree and that experience helped me very much for this interview. Without this experience, I couldn't have solved that problem and would've been rejected. I was asked the classic interview problem on sorted-but-rotated array. I knew the solution for this one and it involved binary search. I wrote the solution for this one and the interview was quickly over after that.            I was told to provide 3 personal references on that day and left for home. About 2 weeks later, I was informed that there would be another technical interview. In this interview, I was asked to implement a simple regex parser. Conceptually, some what simpler than the other interviews, but getting the implementation correct was tricky for this one. I got it right and he was satisfied with the code. I was also then asked about the runtime complexity for the solution. I left the interview confidently.            A week later, I was offered the job.

I have interviewed with FB twice, and both times felt the sessions went well (although considerably better the second time), but no offer either time. You won't get detailed enough feedback to know where you might have tripped up, if anywhere, though. From their point of view, I think this is understandable, but makes it harder to deal with the rejection; if you had fouled up every session you would feel better than if you basically answered all the questions, with seemingly positive feedback from each interviewer, yet not got an offer...As noted elsewhere, it's probably best to be stoic about the whole thing and accept that they have so many candidates they probably apply a ""benefit of the doubt"" policy that works against in their favour; ie.

Facebook,"Feb 18, 2015",No Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. I interviewed at Facebook (London, England (UK)).","Here's my opinion from my experience interviewing at Facebook.They tell you the process in advance. One phone interview, 5 in house interviews (3 coding, 1 design and 1 behavioural). All interviews are 45 minutes each and one-on-one, and you have to write code in all of the coding interviews, and possibly in the design one too. In the first round, one person decides whether you get through or not. In the 5 rounds, each interviewer provides their feedback after you have finished the interviews which means that if you do badly in one then the other interviewers won't actually know.Be fully aware, and make no mistake about this - there is an incredibly high possibility that you will get rejected. That sounds harsh but consider it from their position - huge numbers of people apply, huge numbers get interviewed, and they have to pick people out somehow. They also say that they prefer to avoid hiring the wrong person so ultimately they end up inadvertantly rejecting good candidates incase they turn out to be a bad hire, so the risk of getting rejecting is even higher. Basically, this means you are most likely going to be wasting a ridiculous amount of your time and effort. Perhaps because of this, they are incredibly nice and friendly. This really was the nicest and most pleasant interview I have had.Also, once you understand the scenario, it really helps to kill your nerves if you suffer from that. After all, why stress about something you have practically no chance of succeeding in? Negative, true, but the odds are really stacked against you and you would do well to understand that and just be yourself.The questions are not that hard, I found. In fact, I solved the first one so quickly I even surprised myself. You do have to write on the whiteboard, but that of course means that there can not be much code to write since a whiteboard is not that big. Indeed the questions are not that hard really. I felt that they do expect you to talk about what you are doing but also to get it right very quickly and without any mistakes. They want to see how you approach the problem etc., but get real - they don't want to see you fumbling around, they want to see that you know the answer and can bang it out.Ultimately, even if you know the answer to the technical questions and you get them right you will still likely fail over something you can't really control or even know about. In my case, they said I didn't have management experience, but you know what, I didn't apply for a manager role and they never even asked about management or leadership at all. I was pretty annoyed to be honest, it felt like a complete waste of my time and I felt like an idiot for worrying so much about the interviews.They do provide you with some preparation links which are useful. There is also a book called Cracking The Coding Interview. It doesn't have their questions in it of course, but it gives you plenty of examples on how to solve these kinds of questions so if you read up on it you should be able to bang them out quite easily.Overall, it is worth going just to see if you can handle it because you probably can! Just make sure that you feel good about what you achieved even if they say no."," Make sure you can tell them what YOU actually did in your previous projects, not what the project was.Know how to traverse data structures.Know what the time/space complexity is.Seriously, it really isn't that hard but you do need to know it so well that you can literally write it flawlessly.

Facebook,"May 15, 2016",No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,I applied through a recruiter. The process took 2 weeks. I interviewed at Facebook in May 2016.,"I was approached by a recruiter and asked to have a chat after which they promptly set up an interview without even asking me if I wanted to go ahead. Quite aggressive. I then had a remote coding interview with someone from the US office who didn't really bother telling me where they were located. He had a heavy south Indian accent that I could barely understand and seemed more interested in talking about himself and his job at Facebook than asking about my current role. He was unable to explain the problem at hand well enough for me to understand and when I asked probing questions he repeated himself like a broken record. For example when he asked me the space complexity, I was working under the assumption that he wanted me to make a copy of the data structure. I work mostly with immutable data so a copy is normal. He seemed surprised at my answer and we went back and forth until I finally figured out he was expecting me to modify it in place. I later found out his English language ability was quite poor as I asked him some basic non-technical questions and he asked me what certain words meant. He also cut me off while I was trying to explain my solution to him and proceeded to give me the solution which I thought was rather unfair. I guess at that point he failed me already."," Given a list of lists, where each node has a ""bottom"" and/or ""right"" child, and each bottom child has a bottom child, flatten it to return a list where all of them are right children.

Facebook,"Jun 30, 2017",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,I applied through a recruiter. I interviewed at Facebook in June 2017.,"I was contacted by a recruiter who sent me information and when I was ready could schedule my first phone interview. They are overbooked on interviews so it took 2 weeks to get one scheduled. They use coderpad+ a phone call and it is straight to business on a couple coding problems, there was no discussion of my resume, experience, goals etc. If the interview isn't a solid positive but not bad either, you might have to do a second one, same as first, same 2 weeks to get rescheduled, different interviewer and question.The interviewers are randomly assigned from different teams, it seems to be pretty hit or miss there is little feedback from the interviewer on what they are looking for from you. They just say thanks and that you'll hear from the recruiter afterwards. I was told it would be pretty much a same day response but it took a week to hear back each time. The first time the feedback was that there was no issue with the solution but the interviewer wanted a more vocal, step by step explanation while writing it. He did not say so during the interview though. The second interviewer seemed confused about a recursive solution and asked to have it redone as iterative despite there being no differences performance wise and his final feedback was that the second problem did not have a full solution despite him explicitely saying during the interview that since his request for a iterative solution took up more time that I should not write the code for the second problem, just vocally describe it . Both interviewers did not seem very engaged in the interview so I suppose the take away here is to always be as explicit and vocal about your solutions and try to get the interviewer to tell you definitively what they want because otherwise they just mostly quiet and you only find out afterwards when it is too late.The actual difficulty of the problems seem on the easy side, you need to be able to explain the Big O if your solutions but none of the ones I had involved any complicated tricks."," Take an array of numbers, find the fastest way to sort it so that all 0's in the array are moved to the right side modifying the existing array in place   1 Answer"

Validate Binary Tree for being a Binary Search Tree in O(N) time and O(1) space.Then I was scheduled a video onsite interview:1.

But I did not know this solution from the beginning. So I had to develop this algorithm myself in the interview. This took some time and getting there involved changing the initial algorithm I had thought of. Got rejection call 2 business days later. Reasons were:- I didn't clarify the new approach when my original approach did not work, and started coding straight-away. But I clearly remember saying that original one doesn't work and needs changes rather than simply going on with my work. Also I had no clue about the new approach I was going to implement, and I was explaining the stuff along the way as I developed the solution, rather than explaining it all in the beginning. I don't know how else could have I clarified my approach because I simply could not have clarified in the beginning other than explaining that it needs changes and doesn't work this way which I did.- The approach seemed overly complicated to the interviewer. I was considering to add more things in the solution to make it more efficient, when he asked if it needs anything more (but I didn't when he pointed out its not required), which was termed needless and considered ""complicated"".- I didn't test any other test cases other than the ones given to me. But I didn't test other test cases even in the first interview. So I don't know why I was expected to do it here, since it was supposed to be same format as the last one as told to me by the recruiter.Overall, this didn't seem a fair rejection to me and I was not satisfied with the result."," Check whether string is palindrome or not ignoring special characters.

Facebook,"Jun 17, 2019",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,NAN,"I got contacted by a recruiter on LinkedIn, then had a video chat with two live coding exercises and got invited for an onsite round with 5 interviews (4 of which were technical) in London. The interviewers seemed poorly trained in representing the company and appeared disengaged during the interview. They did not introduce themselves properly, did not seem to have read my CV before the interview, and one left without shaking my hand. When asked how he felt about Facebook's recently announced pivot to privacy, one of the interviewers replied ""Oh, as I work for Oculus I don't care about that."" The choice of interview exercises was fair and appropriate to the position. From the detailed feedback which was passed on to me by the recruiter, it seemed that the evaluation was granular and clearly trying to be objective in assessing the candidate from multiple angles. The feedback was so granular that the recruiter would point out individual questions I had asked to my interviewers, and would comment favorably on how this reflected on certain facets they were looking for. I found this slightly creepy. My overall impression was that people in engineering positions do their assigned job and otherwise zone out, without caring much about the actual impact of the work that they are doing.
