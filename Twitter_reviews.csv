I reached out to a recruiter who reached out to me in the past. In consisted of two phone interviews.The first interview involved adding two large integers represented as strings together. In addition there were some questions about what jsonp is and performance of some JS code in the browser that manipulated the DOM.The second interview involved listing out all the possible combinations of a phone number where each number can be represented by letters, e.g. 1 = [A|B|C]. The followup to that question involved the scenario where the number<->letter mapping involved numbers with more than one digit, e.g. 1 = [A|B|C], 2 = [D|E|F], 12=[X|Y|Z].After that It was an onsite interview with ~6 people (2 hiring managers) with one team.

Twitter,"Apr 4, 2013",No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied online. The process took 5+ months. I interviewed at Twitter (San Francisco, CA) in November 2012.","Short version:The most disorganized, disrespectful, and unprofessional hiring process I've ever experienced. Avoid.LONG version:I applied online, and was contacted by someone from HR to solve a simple coding question and send my solution by email.After that, had a phone interview, had to code some algorithms on a shared document. Nothing complex, but it didn't go well because I went in completely unprepared, and realized my CS basics had got quite rusty over the years.Nevertheless, to my surprise, had a second phone interview, same type of questions, and this time things went much better, as I had been refreshing the typical algorithms and data structures material.I was called onsite, and had a full day of interviews with several members of the engineering team. Again, same type of problems, related to algorithms, data structures, complexity analysis, the usual things.Before this, I had been preparing even more, and I think my performance was pretty good.Up to this point everything went super well, the people were nice, great atmosphere at the office, a very good experience.Now HR takes over, and the chaos starts.So after some time someone from HR contacts me, and says they're working on an offer for me. Great news!A few emails and phone calls were exchanged, discussing possible offer numbers, locations, etc.I'm told all is set, I'd be getting an offer very very soon. Still great news.The ""getting an offer very soon"" is repeated week after week, but there's always something that's delaying the process, or someone that we're waiting for.So, I wait, and wait some more.More than 2 months pass, always with regular contact with HR people, and still I'm told everything is being taken care of.A different HR person takes over, and apparently he is clueless about who I am, how I got there, and basically doesn't know anything about what happened so far.But after some weird phone conversations, the status is the same: ""yeah, you'll have an offer in hand this week"".Then he calls me and says that the previous recruiter made some errors with my process, and they are rechecking everything.Needless to say that I'm shocked by this, but what can I do... Apparently we're back on ground zero or something.The recruiter didn't remember what we had discussed on the phone a week before, and asks me ridiculous questions like:""Are you a new grad?"" (I've graduated more than 12 years ago, as is obvious if he just had glanced over my CV);""Did you interview at our office?"" (excuse me?!)This made me wonder, have they lost my file? Have they lost my interview scores? Do they know who I am? What happened?I was almost in a panic, but still, we keep contact and I wait for some progress.Again, the same old, ""we're waiting for person X to do Y"", and later ""if you don't hear from me by day X contact me"".Day X comes. No feedback. I email the recruiter. No answer.Two weeks pass. More emails.

Twitter,"Mar 25, 2013",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"I applied through an employee referral. The process took 3+ months. I interviewed at Twitter (San Francisco, CA) in February 2013.","The interview process took a ridiculously long time from start to finish, for starters. I was actually an internal referral and from initial contact through the 2 screens all the way to the onsite took over 2 months. Then it took them almost 3 weeks to get back to me to tell me they didn't want me. I've been in this space for a while and that seemed odd to me. The rather large unnamed company I work for typically has about 2 week turn-around for remote applicants.They did the typical 2 phone screens and flew me out to San Francisco to interview on site. Most of the guys on my loop seemed to not know each other at all and the transitions were rather awkward. There was no real pattern to the questions except for the fact that they covered your typical Computer Science fundamentals.Actually, I expected more questions about scale and design. The only person who touched on that sort of thing was a Senior Software Engineer but it was really round about how he got to it.Overall, not a really bad experience, but based on the feedback, I have to believe they could have made up their mind more quickly."," None of their coding questions was unexpected. They all were all fairly straightforward questions about Hash Tables, finding palindromes, etc. However, the one which really threw me was when one of the Senior engineers asked me to describe a ""cool"" project I worked on. This in itself wasn't unexpected but his aggressive attitude was. A very short time into my explanation he got kind of aggressive and started bashing the project for its perceived faults, despite the fact that he hadn't touched on the actual requirements.To my personal discredit, rather than point out that fact, and lay out the requirements and the techincal merits of what I did, I got defensive and it all went down hill.

Twitter,"May 9, 2015",No Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,I applied through a recruiter. The process took 2 weeks. I interviewed at Twitter in April 2015.,"Two weeks prior to this, I had applied to a generic SW Eng role and been auto-denied by their resume screen.Applied through recruiter. Contacted by recruiter to complete two coding challenges on HackerRank. Completed these and was scheduled for a phone interview the next week.The phone discussion was comfortable and enjoyable. The interview moved very fast, which was ok for me because I typically speak fast, but if you like to take a moment or two to think that was not allotted for. There was a brief discussion of some larger networking/sys admin concept and systems. The coding portion was quite brief. The only question I did not answer as desired was the last in regards to a specific rate limiting algorithm I simply was not familiar with. I proposed a structure that would solve the problem, but perhaps not as efficiently, and I am not sure if the Interviewer understood what I meant by my answer. With the pace that was kept during the interview, it was not possible for me to clarify. However, considering we were coding and working in high level languages and concepts, I would not have thought to drop to a much lower level algorithm quickly, even if I had been familiar with it.Clearly there are some buzz words or ""gotchas"" that were being screened for. I've had phone screens were I have been less fluid and immediately correct in my answers that I have passed. The auto-deny on my resume but consideration by a recruiter would indicate this as well. In addition, my phone interview was scheduled as a ""SW Eng, Entry Level"" when it was very clearly for Site Reliability Engineer. Prepare and be comfortable in the phone screen and understand that whatever system they use to find talent may still be maturing.Twitter still holds to the old-school notion that they will not share feedback from your application and they make a point of stating this in the denial email. This practice simply continues the adversarial relationship many employees and job seekers feel in regard to corporations. It is strange that modern technology companies plucking from a high demand applicant pool would continue this practice, as providing feedback to applicants would only help them grow professionally (and not on the company's dollar) and make them more likely to reapply successfully in the future."," If you want to prepare for the coding-screen, play around on HackerRank.   Answer Question"

But twitter is way different then any other major IT organisation. Reason, IMO, HR just sends a bulk mail to ones who are in luck if they are interested, so it NOT like other organisations when they genuinely interested in you but rather HR doing their Job of asking if you wanna move forward.

Is that how twitter selects candidates? Do you guys think, that what we as a candidate prepare 10's of hours to get those question?
