I interviewed at VMware in October 2014.,"I had two back-to-back interviews with VMware on my college campus.The first interview was with a hiring manager. It was non-technical and lasted 45 minutes. It primarily consisted of a brain-teaser question unrelated to software. This interviewer was professional and informative.The second interview was easily the worst I've ever had. The interviewer was arrogant, impatient (to the point of interrupting me to ask the next question), and made it clear within the first 10 seconds that he had no interest in interviewing me.

VMWare,"May 18, 2014",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 2+ months. I interviewed at VMware (Cambridge, MA) in March 2014.","I received an email from a recruiter via Linked In regarding an ""invite only"" recruiting event to take place in Cambridge, MA. The event was to be held roughly 2 months from when I received the initial communication. I was told that VMWare was looking to fill several engineering roles ""up and down the stack"", and that they were looking for ""every background"" and ""all experience levels"".After expressing my interest, I was instructed to take a 1 hour coding challenge via Interview Street (now Hacker Rank). The challenge was a single problem that covered basic data structures/algorithms and could be completed in the language of my choice.After completing the coding challenge with 100% accuracy, I was invited to attend the event, and VMWare connected me with the appropriate people to arrange travel, ask questions, etc. So far so good.2 days before I was scheduled to attend the event, I received a call that my interview would be cancelled. The hiring managers were looking for a very specific skill set, which I did not have. While all the communication I had received up until this point stressed that VMWare was looking to fill multiple different roles, and was looking for ""solid CS fundamentals"" and the ability to ""quickly ramp up and learn new technologies"", it seems the hiring managers were looking specifically for kernel developers with extensive experience in C.I was very surprised to see that such a communication gap had occurred between the hiring team(s) and the recruiting team. I felt that this should have been caught much, much sooner. I had been in contact with VMWare for nearly 2 months! During this time I received very detailed documentation describing the general skills that they were looking for.

VMWare,"Mar 19, 2009",No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 1 day. I interviewed at VMware (San Francisco, CA) in January 2007.","At the time I had my resume posted online; I was approached by VmWare and requested to interview with them by phone.I agreed to take the interview and was informed that the interview would be related to C++ questions.When the interview started, I was initially slightly taken aback at the brusque manner in which the interview proceeded; not unfriendly per-se, but there was hardly any preamble before the interviewer launched into his series of questions. I wasn't terribly put off by the manner, really; this was a screening interview, after all... however, as an experienced engineer with a steady capability to land the job I want, I now view interview processes as a 2-way street and expect the opportunity to ask at least a couple of questions.The real issue I had with the interview was the content. Out of about 10 questions, not one related to C++, which was what I had been told; I don't care if an employer wants to keep the content of their interview secret, but to advise me of the content in advance, but then switch tack without warning is bad coordination at best, and sneaky at worst.The actual questions asked were complex algorithm problems, not generic problem solvers, but very specific algorithmic-related scenarios, for which you pull a known algorighm out of the box and recite it; essentially a memory-test.It became a bit ridiculous when the interviewer indicated that if I already knew the answer that I should tell him this and he would go to the next question.... So I was expected to, within seconds, over a phone, solve fairly complex problems that would normally take at least a couple of hours to review and solve from first principles.It was basically a catch-22 situation; If I happened to know the answer , I wasn't supposed to give it, but if I didn't know the answer I was supposed to, at the drop of a hat, come up with the full solution.It's a fairly standard process to present oblique problems to interviewees and see how they grapple with them; I do this myself when I am on the other side of the desk, but in a phone interview you simply don't have the time to work through hyper-complex problems that have specifically only one answer, and it is impossible for the interviewer to determine your collaborative capabailities; it becomes, essentially, a stress-test.Anyways, in the end I muddled through the problems; for the algorithms I didn't know I did pretty well, I think. In fact I pulled some decent solutions out on short notice. I didn't care if they called back, I wasn't going to accept any job there; I knew I would end up working with the interviewer and, to be frank, I don't work well with people who are inflexible in their thinking. They did call back about a year later indicating that they were interested in talking to me again. At this point I had landed a great position at a different company and was still a bit annoyed so I declined.In conclusion, for this particular group, and perhaps only this person in question, it appeared that they were filtering out people who didn't have robot-savant type quailities. This might not reflect the culture as whole, but it certainly turned me off this place.The lack of a follow-up email after the interview was not very kosher, either... I didn't hear from them again until they were on a different recruiting drive."," ""I'm going to ask you a series of questions, if you know the textbook answer, don't bother answering and let me know and I'll just move on to the next one, OK?""   2 Answers"

VMWare,"Jul 13, 2011",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"The process took 3+ months. I interviewed at VMware (Palo Alto, CA) in July 2011.","Terrible process. Although they were nice enough to accommodate some of my scheduling issues, it was handled awfully. For example, after two phone screen interviews in mid-April that they were flying me out for an onsite interview, but due to significant screw-ups on their part (and a 3 week period when I was on vacation), it didn't happen till mid-July.The interview scheduling itself was quite awful. Thrice, they asked me for dates that I could fly to California. Twice, those dates went by without any contact from them (even though I told them I had another offer, and they assured me they would hurry up). The third time, they emailed me the morning before and said I was going to be booked on a flight the next day! And then after I reminded them at 9 PM that night that I still didn't have tickets for my flight the next morning, they sent them to me about half an hour before midnight. I blame this, in part, for not having enough time to prepare.The interview itself was OK, although I don't think I did well enough to get an offer. One interviewer was openly hostile towards me because he saw my major on my resume and immediately assumed that I was not qualified (He actually said the words ""Your major is XXX. Why have you even applied for THIS job?""). They assured me a result very quickly, within a day or two, since I had to tell the other company that made me an offer to wait.

I interviewed at VMware.,"They contacted me for a recruiting event that was taking place in Bucharest. After an online coding problem, I was selected to attend the event. They were looking for candidates for the office in Sofia. At each interview, there were 2 engineers asking questions. One of them was asking questions and the other one was taking notes on his personal notebook. (There were cases when the other person also asked questions)The first interview was the most unpleasant one; the interviewer was very mild and seemed a little bit nervous. I didn't like the interview at all because it was very Java oriented with questions that you either know, or you don't. As an example, he asked me which was the use of the volatile keyword in Java.The second interview was better, because the questions were put in such a way that they wanted to see how you think and approach a problem. They asked me to write code and implement a method that counts the number of vowels from a given string. They asked about the complexity, about how can we improve it and things like that, on the code that I've written. The discussion went quite well.The third interview was only with one QA engineer. He asked the basics of algorithms (queue, stack, hashing, sorting). After that he asked a design question: I had to write code for a Square and a Rectangle. The last part of the interview was focused on testing: he showed me an API and asked me how would I test it.After that, a guy that recommended himself as being from the VMWare offices in Palo Alto came in and told me that I am exactly the guy that they are looking for, but they can't make me an offer for now; I have to progress on the technical side.Overall it was a nice experience; there were moments (for example at the second interview) when I was so absorbed by the discussion that I even forgot that I am at an interview.

I was supposed to meet 4 interviewers in particular order, but they couldn't manage to follow the order.I was given a pc with eclipse IDE to write some program for a fixed amount of time. The complexity wasn't huge, but the time wasn't really enough to produce a full scale solution.Then couple of guys started asking me questions trying as hard as possible to find what I didn't know ... of course there would be things I don't know ... I'm not a book after all...The guys came up with a WRONG concept too, but they were the examiners, so I couldn't really argue with them pointing out that their opinion was wrong.The team manager had some ideas about managing people and organizing work, but I wouldn't say he was the best of class..And then the HR department wasted another hour of my time to talk gibberish...",Design patterns - tell us what you know...   Answer Question
VMWare,"Feb 16, 2017",Accepted Offer,Neutral Experience,Easy Interview,I applied through an employee referral. The process took 5 days.

VMWare,"Apr 5, 2019",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,I applied in-person. The process took 2 weeks. I interviewed at VMware (Ben (India)).,"One word. PATHETIC.In all the interview rounds, interviewers were too much engaged in their phones. They didn’t much pay attention towards the answers, I was giving. In one of the rounds, I literally had to stop explaining my solution as interviewer was not at all listening(Later I came to know that he was the manager). In one of the rounds, interviewer was so confused that he didn’t even know what he wanted to ask. He changed the question at least 5 times.They do not have any courtesy towards the candidates.On rejection, when I asked HR about the feedback, he said that he has received feedback in only 2 lines that they have mixed reviews and hence they are not proceeding with my candidacy.",Merging point in 2 linked lists.   Answer Question
