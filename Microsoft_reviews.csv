She then started complaining about how the posters about giving on her building was crooked. Generally not a good vibe. Technical interviews started at 10 AM. I had a total of 4 technical interviews.I noticed all the engineers had their own room and not an open floor plan. This shows me Microsoft isn’t very open. All the interviewers worked at Microsoft for at least 10 years and were unenthusiastic about their job. The way they talked about their job and presented themselves seems like their career only revolves around Microsoft and they have no plan to go somewhere else. They probably figured their career is stagnant and staying at Microsoft is the safest option. All interviewers didn't ask me about why Microsoft probably because they don't value a candidate's excitement to work at Microsoft. Instead, they asked why I chose computer science as a major. Overall experience was negative because interviewers weren't excited about their job. The reason interviewers worked there was because they needed a job. Even my recruiter didn't seem happy.

Microsoft,"Nov 15, 2018",Declined Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"I applied through an employee referral. The process took 3+ months. I interviewed at Microsoft (Redmond, WA) in September 2018.","I would like to start out by saying this has been by far been the worst, most poorly handled, and longest (by a long shot) interview experience I've ever had to deal with.It started out with a phone screen, the developer over the phone made me excited for the team I wanted to interview for. The talk was great. I moved onto the onsite after getting the news I did well over the phone and giving my initial recruiter total compensation expectancies as well as additional information.The onsite went really well. All of the members of the team that I interviewed with, as well as other developers in the org, made me really want to come work there. Most of them seemed excited about their work and they all seemed like people I would want to work with.Waiting to hear back took a couple of long weeks. I had no insight into what was going on behind the scenes. Some time later I received a phone call from my first (yes, first and honestly it may have been the second) recruiter saying that I ""needed"" to come in... onsite, and have another interview with a different hiring manager for a different team. I took another day off and did that.This mainly consisted of telling me that my interview feedback was good, and that they would have openings in the near future and that they would want to extend an offer at that point, but I just needed to hold out and wait. He explained the team, which was something even more in my wheel house, which made me even more excited, this time knowing for sure that I would have an offer coming my way.Another couple of weeks later, I receive an email from yet another new recruiter who didn't have any of the original information I had previously given my last recruiter. She wasn't even completely up to date on what teams I had interviewed with or what my story was. No big deal, I gave her all of the information, but clearly no communication from internal recruiters.Eventually I was made an offer. In my opinion, knowing what other developers were being offered, it was a really low ball offer. I had explained I would actually be losing money with the offer they made me. The recruiter took the offer back to the hiring manager with my comments and a few days later contacted me saying she wanted to talk again about my offer.She was very blunt when we finally got on the phone. She explained what she thinks she would have been able to do for me compensation wise, but said she had bad news. She told me they lost the head count and would be pulling the offer off the table, and that she was sorry.I have since tried to contact my recruiter to see if their is possibly other teams within the org that could use my positive interview feedback for a hire, but she is no longer responding.Ultimately, it's time to move on. This experience has made me question why I was even excited to work at Microsoft in the first place. If this is how awful the recruiting/budgeting and hiring process is, it makes me wonder what else is like this internally at Microsoft. All in all, just a terrible experience where I was a hot potato with very little insight and clarity into what was actually happening after being told I would receive an offer.For what it's worth, Microsoft isn't actually offering as much as some other smaller companies.

That was a mistake.The day of the interview came and went. I felt like I hadn't done that well, I wasn't expecting a callback. I was surprised when their recruiter called me to offer me a position! It was not the level I was applying for, of course, but I was still happy to accept. The recruiter said a hiring manager would get back to me soon.Three days pass, and no word from them. I emailed the recruiter to ask what was going on... An automated reply told me she had left the company. I immediately try to call the hiring manager I talked to before...

Microsoft,"Mar 2, 2015",No Offer,Neutral Experience,Easy Interview,"The process took 2+ months. I interviewed at Microsoft (Seattle, WA) in January 2015.","Phone call after applying. Quick behavioral questions. Final question about 9 marbles, 1 heavier than all of them, find it using a 2 plate scale.Get an email inviting me to fly out a month later. They set you up with a nice hotel in Bellvue, WA and a rental car (if chosen). Pay for all your meals - an allowance of $75 a day or something in that area. Day of the interview comes, they pick candidates up together in a party bus infront of the hotel. The bus had flashing strobe lights and neon green lighting at 7am in the morning. It was funny if anything, but quite silly.Throughout the whole thing, I never get told what I was interviewing for. They finally told us and I was COMPLETELY uninterested in the team. That spiked my confidence down. I could've saved MS $2,000+ for my trip if they told me that upfront, I would've declined. Even after talking to all the interviewers, it clearly wasn't for me. So how they got that from my resume I'm not sure.But, that doesn't mean I didn't give it my best shot. Four 45 minute interviews with 5 minute breaks in between for food/drink. The atmosphere was wonderful. It was a great confidence booster. I felt awesome and confident I could nail the position anyway, and after the first interviewer I was told that mobility was a nice perk of the job without even asking! The interviewers started with questions about me, my past projects, strengths/weaknesses, technical questions next, and left maybe a minute or two for questions about them.Technical questions were:-Implement circular array with a k-step elimination-Return sub-array with a maximum continuous sum-Check for a tic-tac-toe winner given a matrix-Without knowing the size of an array, find an element.Strongest interview I think I've ever had. Yet I was told 2 work-days after leaving that they passed on me. I think I fell short on the last interview, with the element in the array, because I didn't realize try-catch was an option to use in a interview. My previous work experience does NOT use try-catch loops, that's a big no-no, they're super slow. I've always used assertions. I got halfway through the question before that and he was unhelpful in pointing out options to solve the problem. He was also a very off-putting interviewer, and didn't seem organized.The other 3 interviewers I had - we laughed, we discussed interesting topics like AI/machine-learning, I nailed the technical questions from start to finish with room for testing and optimization, it was a great time. So my best guess is that last guy talked bad of me, and I was told you need all 4 to basically love you to get in. Waste of time, waste of money on their part.Summary - super easy interviews with laid back atmosphere, great hospitality, but you're left in the dark with what you're interviewing for until the day of and all it takes is 1 interviewer to be stubborn and unreasonable."," Without knowing the size of an assumed sorted array, find an element provided.   1 Answer"

Microsoft,"Jan 14, 2015",Declined Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,I applied through college or university. I interviewed at Microsoft.,"I went through the college recruiting process. Microsoft was among the companies that set up stations at our computer science major recruiting fair where I signed up. The first round was on campus: lasted about 40 minutes, and was easy for a computer science major. About a week later, a recruiter emailed me to tell me that I was being invited for on-site interviews in Redmond (Seattle), WA. The recruiters are extremely fast and helpful in communicating; interestingly, Microsoft's recruiting process outdoes other companies (Google, FB etc) completely in efficiency and generosity. You're flown out to Redmond and stay in a really comfy hotel with a generous spending budget.Now, it's good to know how on-site interviews work: you begin your day early by meeting with your recruiter, who you should befriend since they are ""on your side"", so to speak, and their input can matter in the decision process. Then, you have consecutive technical interviews lasting about an hour each. You don't have to do perfectly in all of them, but I had a very strong feeling that the first 2 are the most important. The first one is particularly important. If you are doing well, you will get a 4th and sometimes 5th technical interview. If you're lucky, you will afterwards get a final interview with a manager of sometimes, like in my case, a really impressive big boss type person. This big boss can basically hire you on the spot, and its pretty cool that you get to meet someone like this.Don't forget that for Microsoft, as well as other companies, several things matter for college recruiting; your interviews, first and foremost, but also your coursework, projects, grades, internship experiences, etc. Also, knowing more math than average CS majors helps.The next day I found out that I was getting an offer, and the next business day after that my recruiter called me with the details over the phone. Microsoft really, really wants smart new grads. The company and culture has REALLY been improving the past few years, and they want smart new grads to keep that up. Offers are actually more generous than at other competing companies.In my case, you might really like the people you meet or have a personal connection with the big boss type person at the end, in which case your offer could potentially be for the team you actually interviewed with. In this case, you have a choice whether you want to be with that team or go back in the general ""hired"" pool which is distributed into teams at some later point.",Thing of a simple O(n^3) algorithm for finding the longest palindrome in a string.

Phone interview consisted of fairly basic data structure questions involving stacks/queues and things like bucket sort.

I made this mistake but it was apparently minor enough since I got invited for onsite interviews.Flew out to Seattle within 2 weeks of my phone interview. We stayed in the commons and hung out with a large (>40) group of other applicants for various positions--mostly SDE intern. It was pretty neat as we got to ride a party bus to the campus. The waiting room for all the interns was very nice. Large touchscreen TV for fruit ninja, another large surface table for other minigames, catered snacks and drinks.I was an afternoon interviewee so we went to lunch first. The Microsoft lunch area is very nice. We got a $10 voucher for any restaurant type establishment. Everything had a bit of an upscale mall food court feel in a good way.

I would advise other candidates to bring their own lunches - the cafe was extremely crowded and it took me the entire 15 mins to get food and pay.I didn't have a complete schedule for the day, so I was unable to give the name of my next interviewer to the receptionist and ended up waiting in the lobby until my interviewer eventually came out to investigate.Since my interviews had run over time, my day was extended by an hour and I did the final coding interview after my meeting with the hiring manager (which was supposed to be the end of the day).I would encourage other candidates to brush up on their basic coding skills (string manipulation etc.) and brainteasers - the interviews were not design heavy.

The first interview was in college about 1 hour, one coding problem about sorting, just write the pseudo code in a paper, not so difficult, the pressure is timing. Then asked some questions about projects in my resume, and questions like how do you think to improve some Microsoft products like IE etc. Three weeks later I was informed they will fly me to Redmond for onsite interview.I flied from Florida and stayed at Seattle for two nights, Microsoft paid all the trip. The first night is a big dinner party with all other candidates over the country and Microsoft managers/employees who will interview us the next day. The dinner is not interview, just casual party with chatting, get familiar with each other, very friendly.At next day all candidates are divided into two groups, interviewed by morning and afternoon separately. I was in afternoon group, the morning is a bus tour for the Microsoft campus, meeting and talking with HR and engineers, introduced the Microsoft life, sports center, science center etc, they want you to like here, treated like we are one of them already. Actually the HR told us once you are on campus interview, that means basically you are qualified to Microsoft, but they only hire top half of us due to high competitiveness.Afternoon interview has 4 turns, about 1 hour each with different development manager. Each turn has coding question of course, write the pseudo code in white board. They are not very difficult, once you are in good hand in algorithm class, it should be OK, the timing and efficiency is the key.Remember I said they only hire top half of the group, solve as many coding questions as you can in one hour with better efficiency, then you will stand out to the top half. I worked OK to the first and second turn, the managers are friendly, and asked question like how do you think about Microsoft, any question/expectation to Microsoft/product etc.But I failed at third turn, my coding solution looks complicated and inefficient, although I worked out, the manager pointed that and introduced better one to me, of course that means mine is not that good. The fourth turn means nothing then, the interviewer not on the interview mood at all, just asked some unimportant coding/question to pass the time.So the result is obvious. All of us know the result right after the interview finished. They call the failed candidate one by one out of the room and told you very regretfully then you can leave. And the other half who still left in the room are offered...This is college hiring, all the candidates are undergraduate/graduate, the experienced one may be different and more difficult. Someone said since the 4 managers are from different team, if one or two are interested in you, then you may be hired, but by my experience that is not true, you have to pass by all 4 to get offer.

Microsoft,"Dec 8, 2014",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,I applied through a recruiter. The process took 2+ months. I interviewed at Microsoft in November 2014.,"This is for a SDE internship. My relationship with Microsoft began when a friend of mine invited me to a dinner with some Microsoft employees who were visiting my university's campus. I later spoke with them and gave them my resume at my school's career fair, and was offered an on-site interview. It lasted thirty minutes and was very enjoyable; I was asked to do a string operation and design a certain object from an OOP perspective. Easy enough, and I had a lot of fun talking with the interviewer about Microsoft and my projects/interests.A few weeks later, I got an invitation to fly out to Redmond to interview on-site for the Operating Systems Group. Microsoft paid for all of my expenses, and I stayed in the very pleasant Marriott Hotel. I arrived on campus at about 8:30 AM and my first interview was at 10. I spoke with the other interns and some of the staff before my first interview, all were friendly. I had a total of four interviews, one of which was over lunch (the food at their cafeterias is excellent, by the way). All were a lot of fun, and my interviewers chose good questions - ones that could be looked at in many ways, answered in many ways, and expanded on. This made our discussions very interesting. I was extremely tired by the fourth interview, as I had only just arrived at my hotel at midnight the previous night. I got back to the hotel at around 3, and took a nap.

I'm currently in a PhD program finishing up the masters portion. I casually chatted with a recruiter at a university career fair who told me that he will pass on my resume and that there ""may"" be something for me at Microsoft but he doesn't know what. He told me to contact the university recruiter in a few days and she might be able to help me better. They called me for a screening interview for an internship the day after.I'm not - what I like to call - ""classically trained"" when it comes to computer science. I prepared for the screening interview by going through the MIT OCW Algorithms and Data Structures course and also reading Miller and Ranum's ""Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures."" The screening interview went better than expected. Among other things, I was asked to design a parking lot and write code for detecting palindromes.A few weeks later I got a call for a final round interview. It took a while for them to schedule an interview and they gave me a date which was 3 days after a major deadline with my sponsor and so I requested a later date. The scheduler worked with my availability and got me a date that worked. They flew me to Redmond for an interview with the Bing team (I wasn't given that information until the morning of the interview). I was supposed to get 3 to 5 interviews. My first interviewer was late because he missed an email sent by the receptionist. Everything after that went smoothly. I got through all 5 interviews. The third interview was over lunch (we wrote code after, not during). The fifth interview was with a program manager. The questions seemed relatively easy. The topics were: queue design, common ancestor search in a tree with no underlying structure, mixed uni and multi byte character strings, detection of unique addresses, and linked list scanning and element removal. Some interviewers wanted me to just solve a problem as well as I could. Others were looking for a discussion of the problem (one of which was actually very interesting and have the interviewer some new ideas).At the very end I asked the hiring manager some subtle questions about my performance and what kind of competition I was facing. It's nice to be told that there is a ""high probability"" of them making an offer :)",Suppose you have a string which has characters that are either one or two bytes long.

I interviewed at Microsoft (Seattle, WA).","I attended a conference and noted down the presenter's email id as I was really impressed with the work they were doing. When looking for full time, I contacted the person for any openings in their team. Fortunately, I heard back from them and got a phone screen schedule within one week.Phone Screen was easy and mainly focused on the projects i wrote in my resume and some algorithmic problems related with those projects.Within one week, I heard back from them that I was through first round and need to come to Seattle for face to face interview. They were really helpful in scheduling the interview according to my convenience.Microsoft takes care of their their employees and potential employees as well in my case. Wonderful and systematic scheduling. I landed in Seattle.Whole day was set aside for interviews, I had 5 in total including the famous 5th interview which is a positive sign as mentioned by many here. First interview, little variation on the level order traversal which i was able to code it with some help from the recruiter who was really nice. You will have to write the code on board so I would suggest do some ""Actual"" coding preferably on some IDE which shows only syntactical errors and runs the program. Eclipse is sometimes too helpful which let's us forget minor mistakes.Second round was a real life project problem related with quick ip lookup, for which I have default solution, Tries. I told each and every pros and cons of using tries and the interviewer was satisfied. I stumbled a little while implementing it but eventually was able to do that with of course the help of interviewer.Oh yeah one more thing each interview is approximately 45 mins to 60 mins long and lunch time discussion is also part of the recruiting process.

Later i realised when interviewer said, let's go back to the office and continue the discussion. This was the toughest round as interviewer went in to very specific details about my projects so one tip do remember some of the tools names, just to name drop them ;)4th round was a short one as the 3rd one went for one and half hours. This one was comparatively lighter and mainly focused on design problems.Then came, the nerve wrecking wait as they told me to wait so that they all can discuss how i performed and decide on the last interview with the 2nd line manager. Thankfully manager came soon and ask me to wait for 2nd line manager. That discussion was very informal sort as he was selling me Microsoft and why I should come and work there.

Microsoft,"Feb 13, 2014",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"I applied online. The process took 3+ months. I interviewed at Microsoft (Redmond, WA).","Applied online and after a month or so heard back and was invited to attend a back to back interview on campus, one with a recruiter, one with an engineer. Both were really pleasant, the engineering interview was a simple programming task done on a laptop: write a function which given a string will return if it contains correctly matched open and closed parentheses. Expanded to include other types of brackets and return if all were correctly matched.I heard back very quickly informing me I had made it through to the final round on site assessment day. Couldn't make the first couple of interview dates offered so was eventually invited to travel to Redmond for an interview day at the main offices. Organizing travel was very easy and everyone involved was incredibly helpful.On the day, arrived at building 111 for mid morning. Was guided around campus and taken to the commons for a free lunch. We visited the visitors center and the company store and were invited to buy up to $120 of discount merch.We then returned to 111 for the interviews. We were each allocated a division we'd be interviewing for (this was not shared before the first interview). We were each interviewed by four interviewers who asked a variety of question covering fundamentals of computer science and some advanced material. We had a ten minute gap between each interview in which the examiners compared notes before we were launched into the next one.Asked technical questions on a number of topics, sorting algorithms and their time and space complexities, binary trees and binary search trees, low level computer scheduling and atomicity of operations, and an abstract data type question. I've provided examples of a small number of questions below.These were mixed in among other behavioral questions, attitudes, what do you do for fun, what's important when implementing software, how to interact with team members etc.It was generally very broad with lots of interesting questions; I wouldn't say especially hard but thats all relative... If you know the field and are well prepared you shouldn't find anything too tough...Don't worry about making mistakes, I know I sure made a couple, the key is checking back over your solutions as you go, work with test cases and when you identify a shortcoming, work out how you can fix it. TALK OUT LOUD! They don't care if you get stuck in a circle as long as they can see your thought process and why it's happening. If you've overlooked something they will happily drop a hint and see if you can rectify.My biggest tip would be friendly and relaxed, make it more of a conversation than a rigid interview. I almost got the feeling they were more interested in my personality than what I wrote on the board, so make it easy for them to like you: At the end of the day the big question they're asking themselves is, 'would I like to work alongside this person', not just 'can he do the work'.Overall, my interview was incredibly positive, everyone was super friendly and did their best to make you feel comfortable and relaxed. The company was very generous with arranging travel, accommodation etc and first and foremost Microsoft seemed an incredible place to work.

Each has a 45-min duration and you have a 15 minutes break in between4 interviews in this round.First one: given the pointer to a head node that contains 2 pointers pointing to any other 2 nodes(like a simplified graph), you need to make a deep copy of this graph.Second one: check if a BST is a valid BSTThird one: given a list of stock prices, you need to find the date when you buy and sell the stock so that your profit is maxFourth one: you have a stream, you need to check if the stream contains a specific string in it. The stream can tell you if it is EOF. You cannot use any STL; you need to write strlen if you need it, you need to write IsSubstring if you want to use it.",The first and the last one are fairly complicated.

Microsoft,"Nov 18, 2013",No Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,I applied through college or university. The process took 2+ months. I interviewed at Microsoft in November 2013.,"The communication started through career fair. When I gave my Resume to one of their representative (current Engineer at Microsoft), he quickly asked few questions to get to know about my background. Later he told me that he would forward this to one of the recruiter and he will contact me if there is a suitable match. I had to raise my eyebrow here, cause the guy has my Resume and he asked me several questions. This alone should be enough to proceed ahead with interview or no interview. Reading other posts, it seems MS conducts onsite campus interviews, then why forward to recruiter. Perhaps, due to lower reputation of my university, they do not want to spend too much time interviewing people onsite.A couple of weeks later, I got an email to schedule a phone interview. At last, something is better than nothing as I get about half an hour to prove my capacity. I have gone through interview posts here on Glassdoor and I could not find any details on phone interviews. Most were either college interviews or people talking about their onsite interviews after passing phone interview. In any case, I prepared myself with the questions posted and later on I realized those were overkill for the phone interview.Now, I have gone through plenty of phone interviews with multiple tech giants. In most cases, I have made it to later rounds in phone interview, but no onsite though. Well, I just want to say I have become quite comfortable with these initial interviews, both technically and behaviorally.The interviewer called on time and we started with discussing my background. This was already done when I submitted my Resume, so I see no point in reiterating all this. Although, I was asked similar questions in my past interviews, but on those occasions, I did not forward my Resume personally and the initial phone calls were the first time when I spoke to someone inside the company.Next I was asked several semi-technical and behavioral questions. Most of these questions are already discussed elsewhere, therefore I will not emphasize much on those. However, I will mention some of them below, cause I think it's on these questions I may have under performed. As for other questions, I am sure ""Design a Table"", ""Test an Elevator"" and ""Determining Apple, Orange and Apple-Orange from incorrectly labelled boxes"" should ring a bell or you will certainly encounter them if you search on internet.Few days later, I got the usual no offer email. The only positive thing I can take is they told me to reapply in 6 months. From what I know, they usually give a 1 year clause, therefore this was a good rejection, I hope.I did give some ridiculous answers which could be a good reason for rejection. I will discuss them in Question sections below. Perhaps you guys could judge if this is certainly worth getting a rejection.",How many lines of code have you written in your favorite project?   3 Answers

They don't ask you anything specific about the team anyway.Almost everything in the Seattle trip is covered including room service, rental car, meals, etc. They really treat their candidates well. The interviews take a few hours (4 rounds of 45-50minute interviews on a whiteboard at their office) and range from medium to hard difficulty. They don't tell you too much about the company/offer/process from the get-go but are very friendly and respond to any questions you have quickly.I would highly recommend going through this process especially if you have a negative impression of Microsoft. The 'evil' rumors just simply aren't true - and the company is great. Their compensation package is top-notch and would easily match Google/Facebook/etc. The disposable income you get is probably more than you'd get anywhere else given that Washington has 0% state income tax, and the living expenses in Seattle are reasonable."," Write a function that takes an integer array and removes duplicates from it (EASY)Follow up: Now optimize it, trying to minimize CPI (HARD) [note: you need knowledge of branch prediction, loop unrolling and other computer architecture concepts for this part]   Answer Question"

They say that if you get 5 interviews and if the last one is with a senior manager, then you'd get a job. NOPE. NEVER. I got five interviews and the last one was with a very nice senior person working there for 35 years and still I got rejected.Went to Redmond a few months ago in a snowy winter day! There were five interviews:1) A very strict (but polite) person, no smile on the face, explicitly telling me that he wont help me and wont give me any hints. It was all about quickly writing a bug-free C++ code to find a pattern in a string, implementing a post order tree traversal with and without recursion and a few research/design problems.2) An extremely nice korean guy who asked about hash tables/lookup/insert/collision in HT and implementation in C++. There was another question about writing all permutations of a given string.3 and lunch interview) A very nice person, willing to help: He told me to develop an algorithm for finding whether a matrix has some properties or not. It was 5 months ago and I forgot the question. I could solve the question but he was looking for a more efficient algorithm. He was willing to help and gave me hints but time was up and he gave me to the next interviewer. he told me that I was going to the right direction.4) The fourth interviewer was very odd. I hope his behavior was planned/intentional and he is not like this. From our conversation, it was obvious that this guy is very smart. He wrote a long input string with lots of delimiters in the white board and asked me to write a c-code to change the given string it to another format based on some rules. It was a horribly vague, twisted question with lots of unknowns and exceptions. In the interview, he was taking nap time to time and he left the room at least three times. Again I hope that this was a test to see my reaction. The reason that I hope for the best is that at the end of the interview, he was the only person who gave me very honest feedbacks and compliments. But if it is not the case, that was awfully/extremely rude. So he passed me to the final interviewer...5) a senior manager, working in MS for 35 years.

Microsoft,"Apr 25, 2013",No Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied through college or university. The process took 2+ months. I interviewed at Microsoft (Redmond, WA) in April 2013.","Initially turned in my resume during a campus career fair. Approximately two weeks later I was emailed by a recruiter who asked me to participate in an on-campus interview (i.e., first round).The campus interview was with someone who wasn't a recruiter and had clear technical expertise. This interview lasted approximately 25-30 minutes. We mostly talked about items on my resume, whether or not I faced any unique challenges and if so, how I overcame them. This was a very conventional interview. Upon the conclusion, I was asked a technical question.About three weeks later, I was emailed again by a different recruiter who asked me if I was available to fly out to Redmond, WA for the second round interview. I had a very compact window to interview within, and the recruiters did a great job setting everything up within my constraints.On interview day, the first step is to meet with another recruiter who is on-site, who will discuss the group / team you will be interviewing with, and answer any other questions you may have at the time. This recruiter is also the one who will tell you the results, and work further with you should you get an offer. After meeting the recruiter, you take a personal shuttle to the buildings where your interviewers are. Mine were all in the same building. Next you meet with 3-5 interviewers, and one of the interviews is a lunch interview. You are told beforehand that each interviewer passes on comments to the next one, presumably so they can confirm / deny a weakness.For me, the first interviewer didn't want to talk about my resume at all. He was more or less the manager of the group and was very blunt about the skills he was looking for. Some non-technical questions were: ""What would you change about Windows?"", ""What do you read to stay on top of the latest technology?"", ""What are some examples of trending applications?"". Then he went to the coding problems. One a mathematical proof, and the second more coding oriented.The next interview was over lunch, and this interviewer asked me initially about my research, but quickly started trending towards questions that were more oriented towards the group. After lunch we went back to his office and I was asked another coding problem.The third interview was more theoretical. The interviewer briefly talked about my research and that it looked interesting, and then we went into an open-ended math / optimization problem.After the third interview, I was told that I would not be seeing the fourth interviewer (this means you failed), and I was taken back to HR to discuss the day with the recruiter. I should point out that the recruiter was very helpful and looked into other groups that might have been a better fit.Overall, the interview was very challenging. You absolutely need to be prepared to code and solve difficult problems. The second round is not about what you have done, but rather what you can do now, in a high-pressure situation. Also, you are told that you can code in any language, but in reality, you need to be able to code in C/C#. Not being familiar with either, I tried to use Python so as to not get bogged down in syntax, but it was generally not well received."," On Campus / First Round1) Write a function that returns the indexes of a character in a stringSecond Round1) Prove that for a set of numbers that are {prime -> non-prime -> prime} (ex. 11, 12, 13) the non-prime number is always divisible by six.2) Write a class that adds or removes data from a queue3) Write a class that can store and interpret large integers (i.e., numbers that cannot be stored as an int).

This was to get an overall idea of where your interest lies in and which team would be a fit for you. Followed by it was a simple algorithm question on linked list to delete a node and to do it in optimized way. Have to give out all the corner cases.After nearly two weeks they called me for an onsite interview. And the process was pretty smooth. Every day i used to receive mails from HR of the things that I need to do and about the travel ad stay. And even received a 'best wishes' mail from them prior to the day of interview.On the day of interview, I was interviewed by 5 people. It involves both technical and behavioral questions. Interview was held at cubicles of the respective engineers and managers.First interview was about detailing my resume. He asked about all the projects that was in my resume. So be well prepared. And also asked if I had any conflicts with other people on the course of project work and how I resolved it. Followed by it was white board coding problems. First it was about how i approach the problem and then have to write a code. Asked about time complexity.Second interview was about the projects again. And he asked me particularly about my internship project. And then asked to solve a problem. We discussed the pros and cons of my approach and then asked to write code. Asked for time complexity. For one problem he asked about the downfall for the approach and then asked if i could find a way to resolve it. I gave him the solution and was moved to the third interview.Third interview was lunch interview. I had no clue about the team I am going to interview with before that morning. And that is the policy of Microsoft not to let the candidates know the team they are going to interview with. So you cant research about them. And so lunch interview is all about you talking. Be ready to question and speak. It all about it. How much you are interested in the job and the team and how good are you at communicating. I started with business model of the team, architecture, technologies used, compared with other technologies, competitors, new features. I also commented on the negative aspects of the product and compared with the features of others. But don't stop talking.If you do well with first three interviews then you will be invited for the fourth one.My fourth interview was more about coming up with my data structure for the problem and then solving a given problem and writing an API. Try to start with normal approach and to make it optimized. And speak your thoughts, even if it may be wrong. They are more than willing to help you out if you are struck. Again this one involved the conflicts you encountered and your influence on any project. It need not be something big. Just show them that you have your opinion and you are in a position to voice it.If you get through the fourth interview , you will be invited for fifth one with the dev manager or director of the team.This one is not technical, but purely you interest again. It was again 60 min of interview.And after one day I was informed that I got selected.",Nothing unexpected. But be prepared to talk about the conflicts you faced and how you overcame it.

I interviewed at Microsoft (Redmond, WA) in November 2007.","msft has two rounds. 1st round is usually on-campus. Recruiters usually come to campus multiple times throughout the year. It's always not a big deal if you miss once - because they'll always come back again in a month or so.1st round is half an hour. Usually 5 min behavioral and the rest is tech. Depends on how fast you are and the actual recruiter, the number of questions being asked could range from 1 to 5.It takes about 1-3 weeks to hear from the recruiter about the result of the 1st round. Then they'll schedule an on-site interview with you. Usually you can choose four dates in the next coming month and they'll finalize one. They'll fly you to seattle (or other location you chose) and take care of all expense (hotel, transporation, meals etc).The on-site interview takes one-full day from around 8:15am to roughly 4pm. The actual length varies depends on your performance. Usually you'll be interviewing with two groups, one in the morning and one in the afternoon and there's a lunch interview in between. You'll meet 2-3 interviewers from each group. If you really screw up your morning interview there could be a chance that your afternoon interviews will be cancelled (they'll tell you your next interviewer is sick or something). You'll get an offer from the group only if all interviewers say yes and if one or more says no you won't get one. So that means you still have two chances (two groups).Each interview is 1on1 (95% of the time taking place in the interviewer's office) and takes about 1 hour. The interview consists of short behaviral questions and majority is about tech questions. You will be writing code on whiteboard. At the end of each interview, the interviewer will bring you to your next interviewer. They will exchange about questions already asked to you and your performance. If you make your way to see the dev manager in the end - the last interviewer, that means you are doing a decent job. If you don't even get to see the manager that means 99% likely you are already out.In the past it usually takes about 1 week after your on-site interview to hear about the result (could be longer if you don't get an offer). But now they expedite that to immediate result - you'll be asked to return to building 19 (it was optional in the past). And if your recruiter wants to see you that means you'll be hearing about an offer. And if you are told you can leave and wait for result, that possibly indicates a negative answer.Now they are experimenting new interview process which is more similar to Cisco's, which consists of 4 interviews which only take half a day, plus some site-seeing and presentations.The compensation is 80k (Software Development Engineer @ 89) base plus up to 20% bonus (realistically, less than 10%) plus stock options.

Another interview was scheduled.This interviewer was strongly biased towards SDE/T positions. He asked me why I applied for an SDE position and not SDE/T. I gave my explanation and was told the same could apply to SDET therefore I should really consider SDE/T. I said ok, but I like SDE (matter of personal choice really). After a lot of chatting about stuff like this we finally arrived at the technical questions. I was asked to return the longest palindrome in a given string. I was barely given 5 minutes (because most of the time was spent in explaining why SDET is kind of better as SDETs focus on code quality rather than just shipping a product). Further few minutes were given to test the code that I wrote.Btw, did I mention that I was supposed to write code in live meeting where there is no way you can edit the text you've typed? No indentation, nothing? (I couldn't figure it out, neither could my interviewer) After this, it took them over a month to reject me. The interviewer said 1-2 weeks.I was expecting so much from this. I wish it would have been different."," Write a function that returns the longest palindrome in a string. Not just the first one or any palindrome, but the longest.

I left completely demoralized.The interviewers were certainly nice, and Microsoft does a great job of making sure that you are comfortable. They paid for the flight, lodging, food, rental car, etc.When I arrived, I spoke w/ an HR representative who seemed distant and unengaged with our conversation.My second interview was odd in the sense that the discussion focused entirely on arcane aspects of SQL and some generic problem solving. That was fine, but then he posed a string interpolation problem on the whiteboard and asked me to write an algorithm...I am a-ok with problem solving, but I am one of the cerebral 'think it out' type of developers. Tossing ideas on a whiteboard isn't how I do things.... and I think the interviewer picked up on this. Ultimately, I came close to solving it, but I was feeling a bit pressured and out of my comfort zone.The third interview was with a very, very senior SDE who proceeded to grill me on c/c++, memory allocation, stack frames, register allocation, etc. While my resume reflected some commercial c/c++ experience, that was over 10 years ago.... since then I have focused almost entirely on java/.net and other languages. More importantly, the position I was interviewing for didn't require any c/c++ experience.The interviewer then chose to present a problem which involved the development of a 'move' algorithm for cribbage. This was another 'whiteboard' problem where given enough time, I could have solved it, but they really, really put the screws to you... and expect you to think on your feet... quickly.The last interview was a 'fluff' interview during lunch, and I could tell that the interviewer was just passing time. Another whiteboard problem followed where I had to develop a base-26 version of itoa(), which was simple enough.... but I messed up on a bit of syntax...The bottom line is that while I was certainly capable of solving any of the problems, the medium/platform they expect you to solve them is totally incompatible with my personal comfort zone.Am I smart enough to work at MS? Absolutely...I have over 20 years of industry experience using a variety of microsoft tools and platforms. I also have a proven track record of architecting, developing and delivering secure, high-volume websites and enterprise systems. This is no BS...

I interviewed at Microsoft (Bellevue, WA) in August 2010.","I made a general submission on Microsoft's career site. About two months later, a Microsoft recruiter contacted me and asked me some general questions about my background. She then directed me to another recruiter who asked me if I would be interested for a position on the MSN team. I said I was interested, and a few days later, she set up a phone interview with the hiring manager.The phone interview was completely technical. I had to write code in a Live Meeting session. First I was asked to write some very basic HTML and CSS. Then I was asked to code up a problem that was recursive in nature. I struggled a little bit, but was able to come up with a solution in the end.A few days later, my recruiter told me that Microsoft wanted to fly me to Seattle for an on-site interview. A week later, I flew out for a day of interviewing. My interview consisted of three one-hour interviews, and one 1.5-hour interview that included lunch.My first interviewer had me code up a pretty standard problem on the whiteboard. As I coded it up, she asked me questions about what I was doing and how efficient my code was. My final code was not very efficient, but that turned out to be okay as she was just looking to see how I think. She also asked me to describe a time where I solved a hard coding problem on my own.My second interviewer had me design the classes that would be required for a CSS parser that would ultimately try to compress a CSS file by merging redundant selectors. Most of my time was spent designing the basic data structures and explaining how I would go about merging selectors. Again, he was just looking to see how I think.My third interview consisted of a one-hour lunch followed by a half-hour whiteboard coding session. The lunch portion was pretty casual where we mostly talked about what I've worked on in the past. The coding portion was pretty standard. I struggled a bit, but that turned out to be okay.I was told ahead of time that the fourth interview was contingent on how well the first three interviews went. So I was happy when I was told that I would have a fourth interview. The fourth and final interviewer was an old man who was higher up on the ladder. The interview was very laid back. He asked me questions like why I wanted to work at Microsoft, how long I intended to stay, and if I plan to pursue higher education. It was my impression that if you make it to the fourth interview, it's already been decided that you're technically capable of working at Microsoft. Now it was time to see if you had the right personality to work there.Two weeks later, my recruiter called me up with an offer.Overall, very positive experience. Every interviewer was very nice. They all tried to make me feel as comfortable as possible, giving me helpful hints when I started to struggle with a coding problem. They were definitely more interested in how you think than the final code that ends up on the whiteboard. Perfection is not required."," You have a pile of coins.

Microsoft,"Jan 19, 2011",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"I applied through college or university. The process took 3+ months. I interviewed at Microsoft (Seattle, WA) in December 2010.","My first interview was a 30 minute on-campus screen: one puzzle question and a few short, general CS questions. If you know anything at all, this is a piece of cake. The remainder of this review describes my on-site experience.Regarding travel arrangements: I experienced a flight cancellation for my return journey, but the travel team was very supportive and helpful, extending my hotel stay and rebooking my flight.Regarding the interviews: most of the advice and information available here and elsewhere online is quite accurate (just note that they generally do NOT ask “mount Fuji” questions anymore), and as there is a lot of it (if you are unable or too lazy to find it you certainly do not deserve an offer from any company) I will only give a brief outline of my experience.I arrived at the recruiting building in my rental car and managed to find a single open parking spot. After checking in at the desk, I had about 15 minutes to hang out in the lobby area with around 12 other candidates. They provide free drinks, xbox, and some weird machines running a program called something like “tell us about yourself,” which I tried to use unsuccessfully. The recruiter took me to an office where we spent about 15 minutes going over the day, some interview advice, and a little about my goals and background; nothing technical or difficult.The first 30 minutes of my first “real” interview consisted of discussing his and my background and me asking lots of questions about the product since I had never heard of it. The remaining 30 minutes were filled by a problem on sorting: design, complexity, and pseudocode. He had a somewhat similar background so we had no trouble connecting. Next was my lunch interview at a nearby cafeteria. There was a wide selection of reasonably priced food (though I had a voucher for a free lunch). I decided on a salad for ease of eating. We talked about the company, the team and my goals. Back in his office, I worked out two problems on trees coded up in C++. The next interview was entirely coding; two of the questions were easy but the third gave me trouble; it was the craziest recursion I’ve ever seen. Make sure you practice with trees a lot, and don’t bother much with general graphs. The interviewer gave me lots of tips, and I finished the code at the last minute. The fourth interview was more like the earlier ones; relatively informal conversation in the first half followed by a technical question, in this case design. I had to design a data structure to represent the state of a game. Pretty open ended… I think the idea is just to have a dialog about design tradeoffs (memory vs. speed and so on). Finally I was happy to make it to the last interview with an upper level person which involved more discussion of the team and my past experiences—no technical questions. Be sure to have something to say about every item on your resume—difficulties you encountered, what you learned, etc. I briefly met the recruiter again and went back to the hotel. In a few days, I heard the good news from the recruiter.So my advice is: 1) ask questions, be curious, and be enthusiastic about the team/product and the company. If you are having a “conversation“ and not just a dry Q&A, then you are probably doing this well. 2) spend a few minutes verbalizing your ideas before writing any code. 3) don’t code silently. 4) practice coding on paper or a whiteboard before the interview--preferably with someone watching over your shoulder. It really helps! 5) try to learn something from each interview, anything, then use it in a later interview; ESPECIALLY if the interviewer specifically gives you advice. They want you to succeed. Remember this if you get nervous.This is mostly drawn from advice I’ve heard elsewhere, but I found it to be particularly useful. Good Luck! Also, everyone I encountered at Microsoft was very nice and personable. The interviews felt mostly relaxed and enjoyable."," Data structures and algorithms, with a bit of design and some soft questions about your goals and background.   2 Answers"

Microsoft,"Dec 12, 2011",No Offer,Neutral Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied through college or university. The process took 1 day. I interviewed at Microsoft (Bellevue, WA) in December 2011.","Applied through the Microsoft website and interviewed on-campus. I was pleased to hear that I was selected to be flown up to Seattle and interview with the online services division (Bellevue, WA not Redmond). I will state early on that I completed the interview process and received no offer - however, with that said, I will be as objective as I can be about the experience.Firstly, understand that although Microsoft does every single thing possible to try to show how ""fun"" they are, by far the number one thing the interviewers look for is the ability to think and code just like any other large software company. Everyone who says that it's important to be social and personable at Microsoft must have interviewed with a different division. With online services, all that matters is coding, problem solving, and wanting to tackle new problems.During your day you will have four 45 minute interviews, with 15 minute breaks in between. After that you will hear immediately whether or not an offer will be extended. This is absolutely amazing by Microsoft. To have that feedback so instantaneously is incredible and truly first-class of the company. These interviews will be intimidating to say the least and I can virtually guarantee you that you will run into one or two people that you really like and think are cool, and one or two that make you second-guess if you really want to work there.Each interview has a coding question. My four were as follows:1) Given the in-order and preorder traversals of a binary tree, rebuild the tree.2) Given a sparse n-by-m matrix, find the number of distinct paths within that matrix (each cell can be off or on, find the number of distinct sets of connected cells).3) Given the Android 3x3 matrix lock screen, generate all the possible unlock combinations that one can enter.4) Given an array of integers, find all the unique elements.I botched the first question. It was 8AM in the morning when I attempted it and I had been up since 6:30. To be quite honest, I had forgotten to review the tree algorithms. I met with the interviewer and he literally bombarded me with questions. If you say *anything* be prepared to defend it and back it up. There is also a strong sense that you must be very, very interested in working for Microsoft. As one Microsoftie put it, ""the people who work at Microsoft choose to work there because they love Microsoft, it's not that they cannot work for Google or Apple"".There is little to no review of your resume. The emphasis is pretty much solely on your ability to code relatively generic, albeit challenging, programming problems. This can work to your advantage or it can be a disadvantage. To ace the interview, simply read a number of programming problems and study up on the division you are interested in. At one point in time, I was asked: ""if you were given a farm of 1000 computers, say, what problem would you try to solve?"". Find something that Microsoft is trying to solve, or some generic problem in the division for whom you are interviewing.As I was not extended the offer, I cannot precisely tell you what it takes to succeed in the interview. However, here are a couple of observations I made (some of which are listed earlier):1) Read up on the division for whom you are interviewing and understand their business well.2) Read up on many, many coding questions. If you read enough problems, chances are you will have heard a problem similar to the one you are trying to solve.3) I cannot stress this enough, but to succeed you *must* ace the first interview you have. I told you how I botched the first question. I did not think to use recursion. In a later interview I had a question that could have used recursion (implementing a BFS), but I chose the iterative process. The interviewer remarked to me, ""your first interviewer noted that you don't use recursion, why don't you?"". These interviewers talk to each other in between! As such, you must absolutely make a good first impression.If you can interview with Microsoft, it is a cool experience. You get two free nights in a nice hotel room and all your expenses paid. It makes for an awesome trip to Seattle. However, I really wish Microsoft would cut down on the number of people they bring to Seattle. Reading through Glassdoor, you will see *a lot* of people are not extended offers. Why bring these people if you don't extend a great deal of offers? I feel their current system unfairly generates a lot of false hopes.If you are interviewing with the big M, I wish you the best. You will have a fun experience and it will be really cool to even just walk through those doors once. As the guy who told me the sad end-of-day news put it, ""we receive 10,000 resumes a week, and the fact that you made it this far attests to your skills"".

Microsoft,"Feb 27, 2012",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied through an employee referral. The process took 2+ months. I interviewed at Microsoft (Redmond, WA) in February 2012.","My interview was for a MSIT SDE position, so my experience may have been somewhat different from interviews with product groups.I had my resume given to a recruiter by a classmate who was recently hired by Microsoft. I was given a phone interview in December, and on the phone was told that I would be contacted for an in-person interview at the Redmond Campus.I flew in on a Thursday, and Microsoft put on a meet-and-greet event for all of the candidates. Free food and open bar, plus a chance to get to meet current Microsoft employees and some of your potential interviewers. It was a lot of fun, and I think helps candidates relax and gain a bit of confidence before interview day.In January, I received information and scheduling for my on-site interview. Microsoft paid for my flight, hotel, food and other costs. In February I was informed the interview would consist of four 1 hour interviews, at the end of which I would find out whether or not I would be given an offer.I flew in on a Thursday, and Microsoft put on a meet-and-greet event for all of the candidates that evening. There was free food and open bar, plus a chance to get to meet current Microsoft employees and some of your potential interviewers. It was a lot of fun, and really helped me relax and gain a bit of confidence before the interview day. We were given packets that had our schedule for the next day, stating whether you would interview in the morning or afternoon group.**The Interview**We were shuttled to the Microsoft campus, where we had breakfast and a brief meeting with the recruiters before our first interview.First Interview:Met with a SDET who had been with Microsoft for over a decade, and had been a PM previously. Very friendly, asked mainly general questions about my experience, what I'm interested in, etc. Then, he asked me to design a subscription service system. After asking a few questions I found that he wanted the tech stack that I would build it on, with justifications for some of the choices. Overall, this interview went very well.Second Interview:I met with a PM who asked me some more general questions, asked me about a previous project I had worked with. No technical questions, and this interview also went quite well.Third Interview:Meeting with a SDET who asked me about past experience, how I got into software engineering (since I'm an MIS major). He then asked me how I would test the whiteboard, followed by how to test a piece of paper. Finally he asked me to write a method to remove all instances of a certain character from a string. He then modified it asking for how to remove a string of sequential characters from a string. The testing questions threw me a bit initially, but I still felt pretty good by the end of the interview.Fourth Interview:Met with an SDE who briefly asked me about my resume, then jumped into questions on OOP. Can you explain OOP to me. What is a class? What is an object? What is multiple inheritance and what are its drawbacks? Does C# or Java allow multiple inheritance? How is this problem solved? Finally she asked me to reverse a linked list, which I completely botched. I had seen it several times before, but just couldn't get the algorithm right. I didn't solve it before our time ran out, and had to leave it unfinished.At this point, I was feeling pretty nervous about my outcome. We were taken to lunch and when we returned, we were told our results would be given to us shortly. My name was called first, which I assumed meant the worst. The recruited told me, ""I hate to do this to you, but we want you to meet with one more member of the team."" I had a final interview with another SDE, he was very direct and jumped right into the technical question. I was asked to write a method to find the max int in an unordered binary tree. I nailed this question, which I think got me the offer.I was later told that they sometimes ask for an additional interview to determine fit within the team, how true this is I don't know.I then returned to the lobby to wait a bit more to hear my results, and was finally called back and told I was getting an offer.Final Thoughts / AdviceThe process is pretty intense but also very enjoyable. If you can, make sure to attend the event the night before the interview. It helps you gain confidence, because you get to see them as normal people, not some sort of mythical geniuses. Plus, by being sociable, displaying interest and being excited about the opportunity, you can put yourself in a good position with potential interviewers.

She asked me a couple generic questions about my resume (""tell me about this position"", ""what's something hard you encountered"") and why I wanted to work at MS. She took the resume and I got a call a week later about scheduling an on-campus interview.The on-campus interview occurred about a week after, in early November. This interview (and every interview after) had the format of: 5-10 min ""tell me about yourself/resume"", 30 min technical question, and the rest of the time ""do you have any questions for me?"" I felt like the interview went well and I was invited to an MS hiring event weekend in December for a day of interviews.When mid-December rolled around, I flew to Seattle and was put up in the Westin Bellevue. The first night, all software and hardware recruits (about 80 of us, for internships & full-time offers) were taken to an event at the Lucky Strike bowling alley where there was lots of good food, an open bar, and bowling. We also got a chance to talk to our recruiters and ask them any questions about the interview process.The next day, we had 4 interviews in a row. One group had interviews in the morning (8 - 12) and the others had theirs in the evening (1 - 5). We found out which group we were in the night before. In addition the morning group had lunch after the interviews and the late group had lunch before. Each group of interviewees met in the same room before the interviews (to eat lunch) and between them. Most people wore business casual attire. The schedule was: interview, 15 minute break, interview, 30 minute video about working at MS, interview, 15 minute break, interview. Interviewers would call us one at a time from the room before the interview, take us to a room to conduct the interview, and then take us back after. At the end of the day, we all went to the same building to play XBOX games and play with the MS surface. Then, our recruiters called us one-by-one to privately tell us if we received the offer or not.I'm glad I got the offer, but the recruiter first quizzed me on how I thought I did and if I had any other offers, and the strong points of my other offers, and how I would feel or what I would do if I did get an offer. I thought that was a little low, since it seemed like she was toying with me and I still didn't know if I had the offer or not at that point.

Microsoft,"Mar 21, 2019",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 4+ weeks. I interviewed at Microsoft (Seattle, WA) in March 2019.","Ultimately, I am here to voice a warning to other developers, and hopefully a wakeup call and initiation for action from Microsoft. The 60 minute online test which I took was stressed to be 3 questions, but instead had 5. The first three were all of the same question form (what is wrong with this code and fix it), but in different languages. It was clear to me these were standins for eachother, and you could choose which one to solve, as the test was only to be 3 questions in 60 minutes, not 5 questions. It would be absurd to have to finish all three of these (c++,typescript,react), especially as the test was also stressed to be language agnostic. Why am I even forced to a language type for these questions in the first place if the exam is language agnostic?In addition, the test did not actually state that one did or did not have to complete all 3 of these quasi-duplicates, which means I had no way to tell whether this was a poorly stated 3 question exam, or a terribly constructed 5 question exam with an absurd timelimit. I was told I did not answer some questions, of which I did not answer the duplicates of course, and was not passed. Did the person grading it not know it was a 3 question exam? How is that even possible, unless the person was not informed on how to grade the exam properly? Do the people collectively managing this hiring process communicate together about the process itself? On communicating all of these concerns, I have received no feedback, and the recruiter has seemingly ceased communications. How ironic.Red. Flags.So many red flags.This is a major failure on their part, and I cannot support or take part in this process, so I will not be re-applying to Microsoft for any position.**And in addition to all these issues, the recruiter invited me to an event previously, which I prepared for... but since she invited me to a second event as well, the initial invitation was no longer on the table, which I was not ever informed of.

Microsoft,"Mar 22, 2017",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,I applied online. The process took 3 weeks. I interviewed at Microsoft (Copenhagen (Denmark)) in February 2017.,"A brief phone screen, with most questions revolving around experience, and various typical questions like ""Describe a project or situation where you encountered a major problem and how you worked to resolve it"", and one ""logic"" question.Invited to an onsite at various locations (had to pick one). There is a group call explaining the day a week ahead of time, going into lots of detail, very helpful. The interview day itself was a half day, three slots of 45 minutes with various senior developers. You and some of the other candidates on that half day always reconvene in a meeting room with various snacks and drinks, and are encouraged to have a friendly chat. There's no pressure here, the recruiter (who follows you along the entire process, even after hiring) insists that they do not have numbers to fill and will select any candidate that is a match. This ended up being incredibly nice and was a chance to discover the different backgrounds of people in the field.The interviews themselves follow a different form depending on offices. Interviewers have a great liberty to do what they feel is necessary to get to know you. I'd recommend the usual (and they will too): Do some hackerrank questions, practice on a whiteboard, read some algorithm design books and brush up on your data structures and software engineering practices.The programming questions themselves weren't particularly difficult, but generally had less than 15 minutes after the long talk to figure them out. What's important here are edge cases, reasoning how you spot things going wrong in what you wrote. Perfect code with all edge cases not expected, but you are expected to spot these problems once you think you are done."," Write a function that, given two input strings and a third ""reference"" string determines whether the reference string is an in-order mix of the first two:""aaa"" ""bbb"" ""aababb"" -> true""abc"" ""abb"" ""abbbc"" -> true""a"" """" ""b"" -> false   1 Answer"

Microsoft,"Jan 26, 2017",No Offer,Neutral Experience,Difficult Interview,I applied online. The process took 2+ months. I interviewed at Microsoft (Belgrade (Serbia)) in June 2014.,"I applied by sending an email to the address specified on MDCS (Microsoft Development Center Serbia) website. About two weeks later, I received an email inviting me to a test organized at one of Belgrades high schools, with a request to confirm my attendance.The test was held at Mathematical Gymnasium and there over 100 people present by my estimate, mostly from Serbia, but also a few from neighboring countries. The test consisted of 5 algorithmic problems, one calculus problem and one combinatorics problem. Attendees are allowed to get up from their seat whenever they like, have some of the served food and drink, and even talk to each other in the hallways.Around two weeks later I was invited to a live interview in the MDCS offices in Belgrade. On the website I read that there are supposed to be four one hour interviews but I had only three. During the first interview I was given a problem and discussed possible solutions for the said problem until the optimal solution was found. After that I was asked to write code for the described solution. After I finished writing code I was told by the interviewer that he can see the bug in the code. I am assuming now that the task was to write down test cases on the board, which I tried to do without writing anything down and without communicating my thought process because I could not find anything wrong with the code. After the time was up the interviewer pointed to a random part of the code and said the bug is here, to which I described the proper purpose of that part of the code to which he just replied with :""I guess I was wrong, there was no bug"", and left. I am assuming that is how I failed the part of the interview concerned with test cases. The interviewer seemed to be satisfied with the course of the interview until the bug was mentioned.After that came the second interviewer who started the interview with standard HR questions like ""Why did you decide to apply here, Why do you want to be a software engineer""... This was my first interview ever, and I thought those questions were a joke that no serious company would ever ask (Boy was I wrong), so naturally I had no good answers. Being mentally thrown off balance by these questions I could not answer rather simple questions concerning manipulation of lists, so this interview did not go well.At this point I realized I had failed and decided to just relax and have fun for the remaining interviews. Luckily the next interviewer apparently had the same idea.He came in good mood and with several quite fun and not very difficult problems. After writing the code for the last of the problems he thanked me for coming and concluded the interview.",I was told to fix the bug in the code without any bugs.   1 Answer

There, I had 3 interviews, each with a different team. I was told I would not be interviewing for a particular team or position, but being interviewed by different teams gave them a good insight. Each interview is about 45-50 minutes1. The first interviewer gave a few minutes to ask about previous projects. He told me he was in the Embedded Windows team. He then asked 2 technical questions (telephone keypad and angle between minute and hour hand in a clock), and a brain teaser. He seemed interested in knowing my thinking process, rather than the actual solution.2. The second interviewer first focused more on behavioral questions and some past experience. He told me he was in the Operating Systems group, focused in security. He seemed as if it was an interview recipe for him, as he would not allow to talk about anything else.The questions were the next:- What has been the most challenging technical issue you have faced?- Tell me about a Microsoft product you like. Why? How has it been useful to you?- Tell me about a Microsoft product you don't like. Why? What would you have done differently, if you were part of the dev team for that product?Then he asked two technical questions (show odd numbers from 1 to N, function that swaps variables).This interviewer did not allow any question during the technical question. He was definitely not interested and what I thought while solving the problem, and did not want other solutions but his. H3. My third interview was the longest, as we had a long conversation. He was in the Windows Update team, in charge of reviewing and fixing upon feedback provided, and deployment. He first asked my most challenging technical issue, as my answer was similar to the first one he asked me about another one. Interviewers share notes between them, so they don't ask you the same stuff. He also asked me what had I accomplished at my job that I was proud of. After some chit-chat on SQL and databases, he asked a technical question (Fibonacci with index)."," A string is received, which contains from 0 to N numbers. Print all the possible combination of valid words, mapping each number in the string to a character in the telephone keypad.Assume no 0 or 1's are provided, as they do not have characters in it.

Microsoft,"Sep 15, 2012",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied through an employee referral. The process took 4+ weeks. I interviewed at Microsoft (Dublin, Co. Dublin (Ireland)) in July 2008.","Typical interview process at Microsoft Ireland is the following:- CV screening / filtering (my guess is that 90% of applications are rejected at this stage)- coding puzzle (solution to be sent in 1 hour)- initial phone screen (HR + simple technical questions)- 1 or 2 technical phone interviews (engineers)- on site interviewSomehow I didn't have to do the first coding puzzle. Likely it was because I was recommended by other Microsoft employee (based in US), so they assumed that I am applying for the job in US. When clarified, they passed my CV to Irish recruiters which moved me directly to phone screening. Probably it's the best to get recommended, so you can skip some initial filters.Phone screens were quite typical:- short technical questions covering OOP, programming languages, databases, networks (5-10 mins)- design question (15 mins)- coding question (typically related to the design from previous step - 20 mins)- discussion of coding solution (how to improve it, how to test it, what are the test methodologies - 10 mins)- Q&A (now you can ask questions)On site interview consisted of four 1:1 interviews (45 mins each + 15 min break) with multiple engineers. Some focus on design skills, some on coding (on the whiteboard), some on testing. Everybody asks some short random questions about algorithms, data structures, programming languages, network protocols etc.The last hour (only 2 out of 10 people got there when I was interviewed) was with a director of the department to which I was applying. It was really hard! I was asked about network protocols, data structures, got an algorithmic problem to solve (similar to ""egg dropping problem""), where I had to figure out the optimal (not any!) algorithm and provide a formal mathematics proof of it's complexity (big O notation).",The last 1 hour interview on site was the most difficult (described in the interview process above).   Answer Question

The lady was pretty nice and smiled the whole time so I don't know if my responses were the right ones or not.The skills test was actually easier than I thought it would be. I was ushered into a room with a reasonably friendly guy and he handed me a pen, some paper and a sheet of questions. Over the course of the test, I was told to answer three of them. They were actually things people could've solved given enough time. Unfortunately, it turns out that I don't do well under time pressure and I croaked as a result. When it was over, he thanked me and led me to the door. He said a couple of positive things about me and we went our separate ways.I'm a bit disappointed at myself for messing up. However, it was a good learning experience and I at least got a free Xbox for my troubles."," Write a function that checks if a number's divisors sum up to that number, i.e. whether it's a perfect number or not.   2 Answers"
