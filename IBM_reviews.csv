IBM,"Sep 8, 2014",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,I applied through an employee referral. The process took 3+ months. I interviewed at IBM in March 2013.,"*Please note that due to the size of the company this process may vary.The interview came in three distinct phases. All were conducted over the phone. I was referred to the company by an employee so they seemed to be confident to not need an in person interview before making the decision.Phase 1 was speaking with someone from the skills management department. She was a neutral party unaffialited with the department I would be interviewing with. She gave a breif overview of the company and what the position would be. After confirming I was still interested I continued to phase 2.Next was a discussion with the hiring manager. This was not technical at all; mostly a meet and greet for both parties. I was asked mostly about my background and what I why I wished to work for the company. The manager shared some details about how the department operates and what I would be doing if I were to accept the offer.Phase 3 was the technical interview. I had expected a number of whiteboard style questions but there was a distinct lack of them. I had already sent in some code samples of a game that I had created previously. The most technical questions related to the reason why I had made certain design choices when designing the code for the game. After that, the questions become more about myself and why I was passionate about technology and to see if I really enjoyed working in this field. Once I believe the interviewer was satisfied with my ability the interview became less about one way questions and more about free flowing conversation to see if I would mesh well with the team. Shortly after this interview the hiring manager called to let me know that they would be extending an offer to me soon.The experience was a very positive one.",What was most unexpected was the lack of typical whiteboard style programming questions in favor of other topics.   Answer Question

There were no specific technical questions. We both agreed it would be a good fit and decided to move forward with an onsite.Between the call and the onsite there was an online interview and coding test. The interview was a bit strange. I had to record video answers to written questions with no feedback from a real person. The programming questions were fairly standard. There was a decent editor and the ability to run some test cases (they defined the test cases). Two of the problems were fairly straight forward (like you would see in an interview prep book). One of the problems was a bit more complex. They gave me an hour and it took pretty much the whole time. The whole coding test took about 3 hours.The onsite was about 5 hours and included lunch. I met with a few managers and one engineer. The managers asked some behavioral questions (""Tell me about a time when...""). And the engineer asked more technical questions. Since the coding test was focused on algorithms the engineer interview was more focused on architecture and object-oriented principles. Everyone was very nice and enthusiastic about the project, which was much appreciated.A few days after the interview I got an informal verbal offer from the hiring manager and set up a meeting with the VP in charge of the group who gave me the salary numbers and explained the project at a higher level.

IBM,"Nov 30, 2017",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,I applied through college or university. The process took 4+ weeks. I interviewed at IBM.,"This was the most insane interview process I have ever encountered, and I would highly caution anyone interested in pursuing it as many people I know have had very similar experiences. They started off with a 3 hour long virtual interview. Part of it was behavioral and part of it was coding. The coding questions were of moderate difficulty, involving topics such as hash tables and trees. Overall this was very intense, but fair. I heard back in a few weeks saying I got to the next round, which would involve a technical and a non-technical interview. The technical interviewer asked me questions related to OS (since I was primarily focused on hardware) and the other interviewer asked about things such as location and job preference. Both went well. I then was invited to the ""Finish Line"" event. They make it seem that if you go to this event, you will receive an offer and there were no more interviews. So I went to this 3 day event in the middle of the week. This involved listening to speakers and developing a project throughout. This occupied an extraordinary amount of time. Basically it was 3 days straight of these activities. By the end of it, I was exhausted and just wanted to go home. Nobody I knew enjoyed their time at this event. However, I was very confident in my performance at the various stages of the interview process. I later received a call confirming this, that I performed well in every aspect. However, they also informed me that there was not a position open at the time and there may be in the coming months. From what it sounded like, I spent all this time interviewing for a position that didn't exist. Of course, after spending all of this time interviewing with IBM, I was furious. They completely wasted a huge amount of time in the middle of the semesters. People I know who received offers were also frustrated by IBM. They refused to tell them the job and location before the acceptance deadline, and were basically bullying them in an extremely unprofessional way to accept their offers. Another one of my friends was promised to be in a certain location when he accepted, and a few months later they said that he had to be moved to another location, totally upending his plans. I have heard plenty of other stories of candidates being treated very disrespectfully by IBM.This was a truly disappointing experience for me. I really wanted to like IBM and I was excited by the prospect to work there. However, I quickly realized how little they care about the candidates and how poorly they treat them. There is no reason a company of this caliber should behave this way, and all of these experiences really show what kind of company this is. I would not waste my time looking at IBM.
