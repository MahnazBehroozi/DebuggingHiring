I interviewed at Apple (Cupertino, CA) in November 2013.","Met Apple recruiter through college fair. I've been applying online for ages without hearing anything back, so I guess Apple recruiters prefer candidates they've met in person.I had two phone screens next month. The first one was technical and pretty easy. The second was behavioral. I actually was really surprised, I had expected Apple's screening process to be a lot more difficult. I was asked to interview on-site next month.The on-site interview was way more challenging than the phone screens. I was still in college, so I knew a lot of things, but none in depth. The questions asked were directly related to the team's work, unlike most other companies -- where NCG's are usually asked questions based on what they've learned in school. I guess Apple's teams look for people they specifically need for a position even for college grads.I was able to hold my own for most of the first technical interview, but I started losing confidence and getting very nervous. By the third interview, I was a mess. It took me 5 minutes to actually understand what the interviewer was asking of me. The last two interviewers asked me about my experience and projects I had undertaken in college and at my internships. They were pretty impressed, but I knew it was too late by then. Sure enough, I was escorted out right after.I guess I was caught off guard by how much more difficult the on-site interview was than the phone interviews, and by how specific the questions were to the team."," Create a synchronization primitive for the operating system/kernel from scratch.

I did formulate an answer waiting for my plane later, and forwarded it to the mgr.The general feel I got was that I was not a possibly valued asset, but a new cog for their machine.

The ""process took"" timeframe below is for the latest interview cycle which resulted in an offer being made. Without identifying the group / team by name, all I can say is that this division deals within a specific domain and as such, the talent pool is limited to recruit from.Mid-'12. The first interview (on phone), as always with Apple, was with the Hiring Manager. The interviewer was very pleasant and the questioning mainly revolved around my background and skills. Even though the interview as scheduled for 30 minutes, the Manager cut it short and told me he will follow up with me within a day. The second interview (on site) ran for about five hours and consisted 1:1 interview sessions with various Managers, Senior Analysts & Engineers and the Recruiter. The Managers, Analysts and Engineers who interviewed me were pretty professional and represented different departments. The questioning, like the phone interview, focused on problem solving abilities and approach rather than the solution itself. The Hiring Manager hosted a Lunch Interview. The last session for the day was with the Recruiter who asked me about my salary expectations and the usual HR stuff.The following day the Recruiter reached out to me and let me know that they were not interested in considering me further at that point of time. The whole process took about three weeks.Late-'12. The Recruiter reached out to me about a new position that would be a good fit to my skill sets. The first interview (on phone) was the customary Hiring Manager interview. The second interview (on site) was slightly shorter (four hours) than my last visit to Apple Campus. The interview consisted 1:1 interview sessions with various Managers and Analysts & Engineers. The questions were domain specific and revolved around problems and challenges that are typically encountered by someone working in these areas of expertise. The next day, I was told that the feedback was extremely positive and I was scheduled to speak with the Director. Since this was around the Holidays, my 1:1 with the Group Director got delayed. The third and last interview (on phone) was with the Director and mainly revolved around why I wanted to work for Apple and how do I think that I am good position. The Director had considerable domain knowledge. Unlike most Director-level interviews, this interview was fairly technical.Within couple of days, the Recruiter reached back to me to let me know that, as of then, they would not be able to make an offer and they would have to hold off on hiring me. While no specific reason was attributed, I was let known that the group was impressed with my skills and the process would resume soon. This time around the whole process took about six weeks.Early-'13. After waiting for couple of months, I reached back to Apple about resuming the previous process. I also let them know my keen interest in couple of positions that had opened up recently. The Recruiter followed up with a Coding Homework to regauge my technical skills. Once I was done solving, the Recruiter promptly scheduled an 1:1 interview with the Hiring Manager. The first interview (on phone) was soon followed second and last interview (on site). The on site Lunch Interview was just with the Hiring Manager. They skipped over technical rounds based on the homework solutions and my past interview feedbacks. By the time the final interview was scheduled, the group had, more or less, made up their minds about hiring me. The final session was basically about what they envisioned for the position they were hiring and if I am truly interested in joining them.The Recruiter emailed me the following business day and let me know that they were ready to make an offer. This was followed couple of email and phone calls to finalize the offer & package.Here are couple of tips based on my experience and from what I have heard from folks who have undergone the same process.* Never ""wing"" it. I realized it the hard way. Engineers questioning you know their stuff and can easily make out if you know things or if you are just guessing.* The on site interviews are exhausting. Make sure you are hydrated and well rested. Interviewers, as a matter of process, will not offer you a water / restroom break unless you ask for it.* For a technology giant, some of the processes are still ""old-style"". No t-shirts or jeans for the interviews. Candidates are expected to show up in business casuals.* Like most things Apple, the Managers, Analysts and Engineers are very secretive. They'll never tell you what they are working on and the expectation is for you to illustrate solutions based on your current job.* On a lighter note, the food available in Caffe Macs are gourmet, personalized and highly economical. Apple will provide you with a ""Food Coupon"" which will be more than sufficient to cover your lunch, twice over.",Tell me about an interesting research project that you conducted or were involved with.   1 Answer

After giving my availability and almost after 3 weeks, they get back saying they want another phone interview. I agreed. Almost immediately after the phone interview, I was rejected. It is not hard to connect the dots and see that they had made the decision already. Moreover, they asked for another round of interview after the first 2 team rejects. It is again not hard to see that, well, the process of multiple team interviewing is not independent.One team asked me to code in coderpad.io.

Apple,"Jun 19, 2015",Declined Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"I applied through other source. The process took 1 day. I interviewed at Apple (Cupertino, CA).","I was expedited through the process as Apple acquired the company I was going to work for. Apple flew me out for one day of on-site interviews, and I had three 2-1 interviews. There was no effort to get to know me in any of them. Each interview was an hour spent entirely on technical questions covering algorithms and system design.The first two interviews were not great, but not terrible. I asked a lot of clarifying questions, which seemed to annoy the interviewers more than anything. Weird.The worst interview I've ever had was the 3rd one, with the two team leads. One of them wrote up a problem on the whiteboard, and then spent the rest of the interview looking bored out of his mind at his phone. His problem was very vague and incomplete as he first asked it, and when I asked questions about it he got frustrated and talked down to me. He would occasionally glance up at my progress (it wasn't a hard problem once the details were worked out) and make a snide remark about what I had written. He expected syntactically perfect whiteboard code, and threw in some expletives for an added bonus. The other interviewer would snicker whenever the first criticized my code. At the end they asked if I had any questions, but every question I asked was met with, ""That's confidential."" It was definitely the most unprofessional interview I've ever been a part of, and I almost walked out of it because it was clear it was wasting all of our time.Unfortunately the misery didn't quite end there, as it took Apple three full months (and 13 reminder emails) to reimburse me for the costs I had to pay for cab rides and per diem expenses. I was also never reimbursed for a flight I had to cancel because of the interview timing, but at this point I'm just tired of dealing with them. If possible, try to get Apple to pay up front for as much stuff as possible, because the reimbursement process is a nightmare. My (senior) recruiter had no idea where to even begin with it, which I still don't quite understand."," The skyline problemGiven a set of interval tuples, find the longest overlapping intervalGiven a huge log file of a web server, find the IP addresses that had exactly 1 requestA network is connected in a line, so that servers can talk only to the servers to their left or right.

Apple,"Aug 8, 2016",No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,I applied through a recruiter. I interviewed at Apple in July 2016.,"I was initially contacted over LinkedIn by one of Apple's recruiters and scheduled a phone call. After that conversation, the recruiter thought I would be a better fit for a different team and redirected me to a second recruiter.Initially, the second recruiter was very responsive. I was amazed at how quickly he got back to me (even late in the evening). More on this recruiter later...I was then scheduled for an initial phone call with an Engineer on the team I was being considered for. The interviewer thought the phone call went well and I was asked to come onsite.My experience onsite was largely positive. I enjoyed speaking with the engineers and the hiring manager. The role was for a devops position, so the questions encompassed both coding and questions about how to do things on the command line and how to automate tasks. The engineers and the hiring manager were very nice and respectful.Now back to the recruiter. The recruiter was nice, but it sounded like he didn't even review my profile. After he escorted me to the interview room, we chatted for a few minutes before the first interviewer showed up. He told me about the team I was interviewing for and what their responsibilities were. He then asked questions like ""So, are you technical? Do you code?"". It didn't sound like he had reviewed my profile at all (I'm an experienced engineer with a decent amount of coding experience).After I had finished the onsite, I wrote the recruiter a thank you email and he responded and said that I would have feedback the next day. I didn't hear from him the next day. A week later, I sent another email to follow up and did not receive a response. A few days after that, I received an offer from another company and I sent the recruiter one additional email to let him know and to see if they wanted to move forward or not, and again, I received no response.Overall, the actual experience of speaking with the engineers was quite pleasant, but the recruiter was not very professional after the interview had concluded. I assume that Apple will not be moving forward, but I would have appreciated an explicit communication informing me of my status. Even a generic ""We're not interested in moving forward at this time."" would have been sufficient, but no follow up is somewhat disrespectful in my opinion.",Scripting questions and command line proficiency questions   Answer Question

Apple,"May 10, 2018",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 6+ months. I interviewed at Apple (Seattle, WA) in May 2018.","Overall, this was hands down the worst recruiter screen I have ever experienced, and a terrible first impression with Apple.Usually, the recruiter call is the fun part. You get to talk to cheery, sociable people and it's a great break from sitting in front of a computer. I've never really had a negative recruiter experience that I can recall. Unfortunately, it changed here.Here were the red flags:Red Flag #1: I applied to Apple sometime in 2017, at least 6 months prior to the phone call. I had completely forgotten about it and figured since I was in a remote location, there was limited headcount. Not a problem since there were more fish in the sea.Red Flag #2: I received a random email from a recruiter. It immediately seemed off because it was simply an apple logo as the subject and a two-liner body asking for my availability and a calendly link. All recruiter emails are sent out en-masse, that's fine, but this one didn't put any thought or personal touch into the body and thought the Apple brand would be enough, literally.Red Flag #3: I open the Calendly link and notice the availability is anytime between 7AM-7PM. Most recruiters have the standard 8 hour availability on their Calendly, not this one. How many hours are they making her work??Red Flag #4: It's call time; it's 7:30AM, we're in the same time zone because the recruiter is in California and I'm in Seattle. Figured I'd be her first call. Nope! She ends up calling 20 minutes late. The reason is because she agreed to do some setting up for some other project, with no warning. I'm a laid-back guy, the red flags are accumulating, I should bow out at this point, but I figure I'll let it pass and take her word that she's just a workaholic with no life (her words, verbatim) and let it go.Red Flag #5: We start talking and she starts describing the team she's hiring for. Turns out it's in SF. I specifically applied to Seattle, my resume said I'm located in Seattle, my LinkedIn says I'm not interested in anywhere but Seattle/ New York, but she goes and shoe horns an SF team onto my radar.Red Flag #6: She keeps describing the team using buzz words: ""fast paced, disruptive, challenging!"". My experience in the biggest tech hub besides SF has been that these buzz words usually entail bad work life balance and coworkers who make tech their life, i.e. very myopic, unbalanced people. I'm already a bit hesitant applying to a tech company having worked at a different one with similar employees/culture, but now my spidey sense is really starting to go off! (""I don't feel so good Ms. Recruiter"")Red Flag #7: I mention how I'm in-between jobs but have some pending offers. This is not a lie, I left my job on my own volition: the market was hot and I was confident of my abilities, and I ended up with a few competitive offers within a 2 weeks and was quickly approaching offer deadlines. Unfortunately, that went in one ear and out the other because all she heard was how I was in between jobs and how that was going to be a huge red flag on their side and was asking why I left. Doesn't matter that I need to sign an offer within a couple of weeks and need to interview ASAP, she's just grilling me why I left. Keep in mind that this was no issue with other recruiters, but this recruiter was grilling me like your worst recruiting horror story.Red Flag #8: I tell her that I left because I wanted a change after a few years at ex-company, I wanted a vacation between jobs, and because the previous job was not a good culture fit since we were working 60 hour weeks and it had a lot of the myopic engineers I mentioned earlier (can you guess why I'm weary of tech companies at this point?). Once again, it went in one ear and out the other. I have always been this candid with recruiters and it leads simple understanding from the recruiters and often times job offers. Again, this recruiter had to go out of her way to grill me on how that won't fly at Apple, and how I sound like I don't want to work! Apparently not working 60 hours means not working, though I should have inferred that reasoning from her schedule.At this point she says she'll submit me to the SF teams but I've made peace that Apple is not a company I want to work at based on this interaction. I sign another offer and send an email that I will not be going forward with them.I understand it's a big company and I shouldn't make blanket statements like this, but this was an interaction so far left field from any other recruiter interaction and was so surreal, that it sounded more like a ""Silicon Valley"" skit, than a real phone call. It was so surreal that I'd be very weary of future interactions with the company if this is how the people that are supposed to be the friendly ones behave.Moreover, Apple is always excluded from conversations amongst software engineers when it comes to GOOG/MS/AMZN/FB, and from this interaction it makes sense why.",What your work experience was and what you're interested in.   Answer Question

Apple,"Oct 16, 2018",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 3 weeks. I interviewed at Apple (Cupertino, CA) in October 2018.","Super weird experience. I would just like to start off by saying I interviewed for a position that did not belong with my prior experience. First, a recruiter found my resume through the GHC database (i'm a university grad) and asked me if I wanted a phone interview w/ the hiring manager. I had the interview (behavioral) and they then matched me with a position based on my conversation with the hiring manager (?) . I figured that they knew my resume and that they wanted me for the position based on that (considering they reached out to me and I never applied). They also were being very accommodating with scheduling my interviews so I figured there was a little interest there. When I went to the onsite, I had interviews (2:1) from 11-4:30. All were technical (java) except for one puzzle question and similar to medium/hard on leetcode. I could tell that they weren't really interested in me from the very beginning and it seems like they only interviewed me for some quota reason or something that I have yet to figure out. I still have no idea why they brought me onsite because the role (that I discovered during the day) was totally different than anything on my resume that there is no way they actually thought of me as a possible candidate. When I got there, most of the people I met were extremely rude. All of them were on their phones at some point during the interview. None of them took any interest about my background or cared to look at my resume. There was no human element to the process. It seems like they just wanted someone who had been practicing leetcode for months. I knew that I would hate working there so they weren't a good fit for me as much as I wasn't a good fit for them.I would also like to mention that apple's interviews are team based so this was just my case with a specific team. Others could be better or worse.Overall, super disappointed in the lack of care Apple took in the selection process and the rudeness of some of the interviewers.

Apple,"Jun 3, 2010",No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,I applied through college or university. The process took 1 day. I interviewed at Apple in June 2010.,"Have had several interviews with Apple (for new grad/intern), here's what I've gathered.Process-HR doesn't communicate very well (or at all) with other HR reps. Apply for multiple positions (if applicable).-You'll do an initial phone screen with the ""Manager"". Followed by 2-3 (3 is typical), with engineers within that team. From there, they'll do a full-day onsite grilling fest.-Interviews are very scripted and directed. Probably due to the sheer amount of candidates, questions tend to be very generic and/or involve classical responses.-It's typical for them to be late/tired or rushed. Honestly, this alone sends the wrong signals.-Very little communication regarding applicant status. Be assertive. Rule of thumb is, if you fail to hear back within the next couple of days, it's not happening.Materials-It varies.-Some interviews like to play the syntactic pop trivia question game (what's a static member, memory segments, etc). Be warned, sometimes the question doesn't have a ""easy/clean"" answer (i.e. impL specific).-Situational answers (If you pissed off a co-worker...etc), not as frequent.-Some behavioral (not typical).-Most of it is problems. Study data structures, algorithms, and classical approaches to typical CS related situations (How do you think spell check is impL? Complexity of a phone queue? Real life deadlock?).-Questions seem to be regurgitated and/or spun off classical questions.Responses/Feedback-You won't get ANY feedback.-Asking about culture, motivations, is probably a waste of time.-Be honest, concise, & elaborate if needed, and say. ""I dont know"" if you... don't know.Overall-I love Apple as a company. I love their products. But the HR dept seems be borderline laughable. I think it's the quantity over quality issue (in screening). Canned rejection responses are typical, and I wouldn't sweat not getting the gig. You can easily try in another area.

The recruiter scheduled the phone interview a week later and he said the manager of one of the teams was going to do the interview. To be honest I really prepared for this phone interview and I concentrated on generic Computer Graphics concepts, Operating System concepts and C++ concepts, and to my surprise that were exactly the topics we covered during the interview. To my surprised though the manager of the team didn't show up but rather a technical lead with a very strong asian accent, so I was asking to repeat himself on my occasions.

Apple,"Jun 7, 2015",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,I applied online. The process took 4+ weeks. I interviewed at Apple (Singapore (Singapore)) in May 2015.,"I was interviewed for Software Engineer in Singapore for Emerging Technologies team.Phone interview as first engagement, which was more like background check and some technical proficiency assesment. To see where you're good at. Then moving on to onsite interview, I have 4 rounds back-to-back.First meeting with the recruiter - to get your current career view and asking about salary. Then second round, interviewer was late for half an hour so i had to call the recruiter again. They are asking about Java, security (PKI, authentication, encryption) concepts, and Linux commands to check cpu stat, search open port remotely, etc. At this round, the interviewer demands lots of answers for exact filenames (e.g to configure tomcat, sysctl file name) which gets very frustrating. I think some people who works more on other technologies will find it very hard even though they understand the how-tos. They also dont answer questions related to the roles and impose secrecy and ""you will know if you join"" notion, rude. Third interview is more to understand on the networking and core java, sql knowledge. I find it very helpful if you prepare for reviewing tcp udp concepts, read java books for basics. Fourth interview, is again a general question regarding many topics like Java, shell scripting, sql.Second onsite interview, i am faced with the hiring manager. In here we spoke more about the work i've done, explain some server architectural concepts and design. I guess they want to access your knowledge vs their setup and see if things match. He said it will be another interview for final round.Then finally 3rd and final round is with engineering director (hiring manager's boss). Here it is more to speak your background and why you want to leave your job, he is accompanied by one technical person in my case. I guess he is there to assess and help if there is some technical concepts to verify. The director then speaks more about the vision for the team and assess your knowledge on scaling your deployment.BUT after last interview, NO NEWS whether i'm accepted or not, nada zilch. The recruiter have contacted me once to checkup for the expected details, buy no news after even with follow up several times. I'm terribly disappointed with this kind of behavior from Apple. Really.

Apple,"Jan 10, 2015",No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,I applied through a recruiter. The process took 3 weeks. I interviewed at Apple in October 2014.,"- I submitted my resume to the Grace Hopper Celebration database, and it was forwarded to multiple Apple recruiters who were looking for New Grad candidates.- Each team at Apple has its own designated recruiter, and because my resume was distributed to many teams, I ended up doing a number of phone screens. The phone screens usually were not difficult because they were only 30 minutes long. They mostly tested knowledge based trivia questions along with asking about your past work experiences and projects. It was pretty overwhelming because multiple recruiters were trying to contact me, all from Apple, but it felt ridiculous having to do so many phone screens that all essentially looked for the same skill sets. They even had a recruiter that just started her job, who contacted me by the wrong name and wrote down the wrong information about me, which I felt was fairly unprofessional and disorganized.- Because there were many teams in contact with me, they hired a single POC recruiter to manage my onsite, which really helped. Scheduling an onsite during the fall is a bit difficult because Apple gives their employees the entire Thanksgiving week off, and many people go on vacation during December. Anyways, I ended up scheduling it and was told I would have 4 2-on-1 interviews. It turned out to be 8 45-min interviews for 4 different teams and I didn't find out until I had a ""break"" when a hiring manager came to talk to me. Thinking back, it was probably the most mentally stressful day of my life. Note that I probably could have split it up into two days, but because I had other obligations, I asked for a single day interview.- In terms of question style, most teams liked to focus on problem solving and algorithmic questions, covering data structures, trees, graph search, etc. one of the teams asked me to find bugs in a piece of code. Another team really focused on class design and asked me to describe the architecture one of my past projects.- Although I was offered breaks in between the interviews, I felt pressured not to take them to keep everyone on schedule. It was also really tough doing so much talking throughout the day (literally met with 16 people that day). My performance was likely diminishing as the day went on, and I knew I didn't do too well on some of the interviews.- The overall feel of the Cupertino office: the building I was placed in was beautiful. The cafes serve extraordinary food and the people I talked to were very smart and sounded like they were doing exciting work. As often noted, Apple is pretty secretive even internally. Some teams I talked to say they do code review through email, which I found pretty strange.- In the end I did not move on to the next round (which would be another onsite for whichever teams were still interested). Overall, I wish that Apple had a more generalized interviewing process for New Grads. The disorganization really displays how segregated Apple is as a company.",Describe the architecture and class structure of a component in one of your side projects.   Answer Question
