After I cleared that there were total 4 technical rounds. 3 rounds happened on a weekend and for the 4th round they called me on a Monday. Questions were mostly on the testing perspective for a big system like ATM, Social Networking Site etc. The interviewers also asked few puzzles on balls, height etc. There were questions from Java Collections as well. All the interviewers asked me to write a full fledged code and asked me to optimise it further. They also provide food in between. All the people were very humble and I really like the smoothness of the process.After 1 week I got the mail from HR that I am selected and will soon get HR call but instead of a call I directly got an Offer Letter.

On the technical side was asked about prior experience as a ""wram"" up question then an algorithm. They covered all the standard data structures: Navigation in the binary tree, linked list, search in the graph, system design based on the hash table. Some of the guys seemed very relaxed and the process was sort of working session with a collegue and some of them were a bit distant, and it was a bit hard to read-up anything from them. I got a bit intimidated when I made couple of mistakes but overall process was ok. I didn't receive an offer.",Positive Experience
Amazon,"Made it to the 3rd round interview. First round was a basic HR interview where they inquired about my goals and aspirations. The second round involved actual technical questions, but not too hard. The third round became a lot harder, with questions related more to theoretical concepts.

The questions very fairly simple bit manipulation and data structures.,Positive Experience
Amazon,"1 coding interview through website, 1 over the phone, 1 in-person. I had to listen to a problem, then right the code for that problem. Overall, I had fun with it. The questions were not too difficult. There was one point where I was struggling to come to a solution, because I was trying to explain and think at the same time. When I got stuck, the interviewer gave helpful tips to guide me in the right direction and I used it. If you can't get a particular solution on your own, getting the solution with a hint is the next best thing.",Positive Experience

After a week, I was informed that they want me to go on-site for a formal interview.The onsite interview was tough, I've talked to seven interviewers. Each one for one hour. Most interviewers are friendly. Some questions are really tough and open. I know I still have so much to improve interms of my technical skill.

Amazon,"Applied for a intern position last year. Apparently all positions were full at the time and invited me to interview for a full time position this year instead.Started off as 3 online technical questions. Know your basic data structures and algorithms in and out and it will be (and should be) a breeze. Remember to relax though.If you pass they will invite you to a onsite interview. Amazon will take very good care of you during the interview process, flight, rooming, expenses will be all paid for (within reason).The onsite interview will start off with lunch with a bunch of other candidates and some interviewers. Don't worry, you are NOT competing against each other, Amazon needs every smart person they can get.After lunch they will move you to your testing room, where you stay and 4 interviewer will come in and out with various HR questions combined with the programming question.Other --Amazon will give you documents on what to expect during the interview. Honestly I think the process is very fair as they don't throw any curve balls.Tips --* Again, I cannot stress enough to know your data structures and algorithms (graph traversals, structures of dynamic programming, etc). They are the building blocks for solving any type of programming problem.* Talk, no matter how stupid it sounds. Talk out what you're doing. Talk if you're stuck, talk if you have an idea, talk as you write down line for line.* Always remember to smile this should be easy as you should be enjoying this. If not, you might be in the wrong field.Complaints:Being bombarded by 4 interviewers and while your brain is racing as fast as possible is exhausting. Amazon does not pay/reimburse alcoholic purchases. As many fellow interviewees genuinely wish to de-stress afterwards.",Positive Experience

Amazon,The recruiter moves very fast in setting up the interviews. I first chatted with one team member over the phone. He asked me some technical questions.

Amazon,"An Amazon recruiter came to my University to give us a spiel about working at Amazon and accepted resumes at that time. She contacted me by phone to see if I would be interested in interviewing. This was an expenses-paid trip to Seattle for a few days.The day started with a general QA session with some really nice Amazon SE Engineers. The bulk of the interview after that was a group programming project; we were given a task, split into teams of 3, and had around 6 hours to program. We were pulled out individually during that time to discuss our individual implementation and ideas. They wanted to, of course, discuss the time complexity of the implementation. I was a bit turned off by the fact that they asked 0 questions about projects we had worked on in the past or questions to learn more about us as people--but maybe they were getting some of that information just by observing how we interacted with our teammates?I personally think I flubbed this one--I got flustered at the start and it took me too long to get started. Be prepared to think through a large, complex problem that could involve a lot of programming and data structures. The problem in our case was divided into three parts--I took the third one, but I think it was more reliant on the other parts than I had anticipated. I recommend trying to pick a part of the problem that doesn't necessarily build from the other parts if you plan to ""divide and conquer"" to solve the problem.If I had to do it again, I might try a more team-oriented approach. Instead of trying to get everything implemented in such a short amount of time, work together to really iron out the implementation on paper, and THEN get started on the implementation with really well-defined (and modest) goals for each programmer. One of the reasons I didn't feel quite comfortable with this approach at the time is that one of my teammates was sort of bashing people he had programmed with in the past... and I felt uncomfortable about adding myself to his roster of bash-ees! If I do apply again in 6 months as Amazon suggested, I'll be sure to ignore such impulses and really apply myself to the idea of working as part of a team.",Positive Experience

Facebook,"It's not an interview really, but a series of tests.Approached by a recruiter, had a phone conversation and then an on-site coding test (could also have been done by phone, but I live nearby). After another phone conversation with a recruiter who explained the process, came into their office for another series of four tests - 2 more coding tests, a design question and one with some vague personal questions and YACT (Yet Another Coding Test). Questions are not too difficult, but I'm assuming they expect near-perfect performance (mine was not :)Everyone was very friendly, positive and respectful, so even though I was rejected, all in all a positive experience - as someone often involved in recruiting myself, I think we can all learn a lot from how it's done there, especially when it comes to giving candidates a good feeling, regardless of outcome.",Positive Experience
Facebook,"first screening interview followed by onsite interview 5 interviews with coding problems and behavior. the people were friendly, and the recruiters were very helpful in answering questions. the interviewers talked passionately about the projects they were working on as well as projects that they weren't working on but aligned with my interests inside the company that were ongoing.",Positive Experience

After chatting with the recruiter briefly over the phone, she quickly set me up for a phone interview, which was not that difficult/unexpected. This was followed by a half-day on-site interview, which involved lunch followed by meeting with four separate employees four 45-60 minutes each. Interviews were back-to-back, and the last interviewer escorted me back to the lobby.",Positive Experience
Facebook,"The FB recruiters were very on-the-ball and determined to get me to campus, and worked with me every step of the way. They flew me out, put me up in a nice hotel, and helped me know what to expect in the interviews. The process consisted of four interviews, broken up by lunch. Two ""ninja"" interviews (coding), one ""jedi"" interview (personality and values), and one systems design interview (whose cool name I forgot). The questions were tough, but fair. They definitely have a preference for code questions that combine data structures and creative thinking. My only complaint about the process was that they would spend a little too much time prior to starting the coding question asking me about my OS knowledge (I interviewed for a mobile job), and that left me pressed for time (sometimes) on the actual whiteboard coding.",Positive Experience

Facebook,"Overall, it's an AWESOME experience.My friend referred me to and a recruiter reached out to me within a week on January 18th. They initially scheduled a phone screen on January 23rd but I was told I could skip the phone screen on January 22nd. They did not tell me the reason why but I'm very sure it's because of the strong internal referral from my ex-coworker who is also my good friend.The onsite interview was scheduled for January 30th. The onsite interview was five sessions - Two coding interviews, two career discussion + coding interviews and one system design interview.The system design interview was very interesting. This is my first time doing system design interviews because they are targeting me as E4. The interviewer asked me to design a domain-specific system but I didn't have any specific experience in that field. He was cool with that and he was able to make the question general enough so that I was able to build my solution and show off my system design skills. One master tips for system design interview was to do a mock interview with your friend. The Facebook recruiter also sent out useful information on how to prepare for system design interviews, which was also super helpful.If I have to name one thing I didn't like that much was two career discussion + coding session. It was a little bit too much since the career discussion part took almost 40 minutes so I end up speaking for 80 mins non-stop which was super tiring. Honestly, I think one career discussion + coding session is enough already. There is really no point to having two there. The 5 minutes coding was also a rush that there is no time for me to walk through my code. One of the interviewers said ""you don't have to explain to me"" when I was doing the coding part, which was a head-scratcher. I'm an interviewer as well and the big part of the technical interview is to expect candidates to communicate well.Two coding interviews went well. The first interviewer thought I did too quick and we end up solving three questions in one interview. I don't know if he suspected that I already saw the questions (which I did not) so he had to ask two additional questions. The second interviewer asked a relatively more complex question than the first interviewer but it was just a practical question so as long as you are comfortable with algorithms and data structures, you are good. They apparently were disallowed to ask brain teasers.I also got an additional exploratory chat that I requested with a manager from WhatsApp who walked me out of the MPK 12 building.My recruiter friend touched base with me three days later (February 2nd, Friday) and told me that my overall feedback looks good (sounds intentionally vague) and we are moving to the two approval meetings on next Monday and Tuesday. I was informed that my offer is approved on Tuesday afternoon.My recruiter friend then helped me to schedule calls with different teams' manager. I got very interested in talking with a director in Instagram which I'm a super fan of. After series of phone calls, my recruiter called again and spent an hour to help me get my questions answered. The discussion was very transparent and smooth. We also talked about a lot of topics including career development, team selection, and the offer competition process because by that time I also got an offer from Google.I actually made the final decision before the final offer numbers came out. Of course, I did not tell them my final decision until offer competition was finished because I want to get more if possible. The main factors that drove me to choose Facebook were ...1) The impact drove culture. Note that I do not think this culture would fit everyone but it should fit me very well because I am passionate about impacting and leading people around me. I'm kind of ambitious personality in terms of my career so impactful and competitive working environment is my catalyst.2) The ultimate flexibility of team mobility. Their boot camp program ensures that you are working in a team that you are happy with (at least for mid term) and you are encouraged to switch team if you are unhappy after a certain period of time. They also have a program called HackerMonth (I might misspell) that allows you to try to work in another team for a month every year.3) Great recruiting experience. Choosing between Google and Facebook was VERY hard and one of the factors that drove me towards Facebook was their recruiting experience. The recruiter was super engaging and extremely responsive. She even responded on Sunday night. Recruiting experience might highly depend on the specific recruiter you get, though.I'd definitely recommend engineers who are passionate to build to try Facebook. It's a unique experience that I felt so grateful to have.",Positive Experience
Facebook,"I applied online through the Facebook website and heard back from HR within 2 weeks. After speaking with the recruiter, we setup a phone interview with one of the engineers. The phone interview was about 20 minutes long and consisted of 2 questions which were algorithmic in nature, one of which was reversing a linked list. I heard back from them about a week later and we setup a time for an on-site interview. I was alotted $1000USD for travel expenses to travel from Toronto, ON to Palo Alto, CA. The on-site interview lasted 4 hours and was split up into 1 hour interviews with a different engineer. The questions were mostly abstract, and language independent. Content of the questions varied from riddles to database design. My impression of the first three engineers was good, they seemed like nice guys, and knowledgeable. The last interviewer came off as pretentious, I felt as though he wanted me to fail -- just my opinion!Overall, the office culture seemed relaxed and the problems they are solving there are interesting ones. I'd recommend interviewing with them if only for the chance to visit Palo Alto!",Positive Experience

After completely bombing one of them but doing well on the other I was brought in a little bit later for the full interview. I had about 5 people interview me. Afterwards they were still unsure so I had a couple phone interviews/conversations.The recruiter did a great job of keeping me up-to-date about what was happening, was very honest with me, and was able to rush to get me an offer (which was especially nice because it was almost Christmas at the time)",Positive Experience

Facebook,"I am an experienced engineer. My phone interview was pretty standard. I got through 2 coding questions, and had a great chat with the interviewer. I was called onsite shortly.Onsite I had 5 modules. 3 ""ninja modules"", which are coding based, 1 ""jedi module"" which is behavioral/resume/experience and a small coding problem, and 1 ""pirate module"", which is system design. I've done interviews with Google and LinkedIn as well (and got offers from both), and the coding problems at Facebook were actually the simplest. I smashed all the coding interviews. The Jedi interview was pretty good too.The place where I failed was the pirate module. If you are interviewing with FB, I cannot stress enough that you really really need to prep system design. I actually failed my design interview spectacularly (they asked me to design a popular feature on FB). But based on my other performances, they decided to call me back the next week for another system design interview. Well, I failed that one too, LOL. Yes, apparently I was that bad at system design.It is strange, because at Google I was specifically told that the system design interview was used to ""slot"" a software engineer only (senior, staff, etc.). i.e. it was not a dealbreaker. For FB, apparently it is a dealbreaker. Personally I think every one has certain strengths and weaknesses. I readily admit that my weakness is system design. My strength is algorithms and coding, and I've actually done pretty well in competitive programming as well. But FB really would prefer to see someone who knows a decent amount about everything, rather than be really good at one thing (algorithms and coding) and not great at another (system design).As far as the interviewers go, they were an amazing bunch. Even when I was bombing the system design module, the interviewer was very respectful, encouraging, and friendly. I walked away with a very positive experience. Everyone was excited to be working there, and I can see that it is a terrific place!If you are interviewing there, my advice is to really read up on many many open source architectures, and thoroughly understand system design. If you clear that module, you will almost certainly get in, the other stuff isn't hard at all.",Positive Experience

For each involved finding the solution (easy to optimal) and then write code optimal solution. I did this pretty well as I had prepared for data structures and algos.They immediately called me for full day onsite interview. Again I prepared lot on data structures, algorithms and related problem solving. And boom..that was my mistake. I forgot to focus on system side (locking, synchronization, deadlock) in detail. 5 interviewers, 45 min each. No on asked on data structures/algo.

Most engineers in Google, Bangalore do what I have been doing for 4-5 years, yet none of their interviews were focused on my past projects. Apparently, Google claims that they look at the candidate's thought process, it's wasn't so in my case! I got 2 questions partially correct and *I think* I did well in all others in 5 interviews and still got rejected. The feedback from the recruiter was that a ""a couple of interviews went well but a couple others didn't go so well""Insider story is that every interviewer gives you a score1- no hire2- no hire, but unsure3- hire, but unsure4- hireYou must get an average score > 3.5 for the local hiring committee to approve your application. I think mine got scraped at the local level itself.Overall, the interview experience was positive. I had a couple of easy phone screens and they provided to and fro tickets to Bangalore, accommodation and local transport. The pace of the interviews was comfortable, there was free lunch and everyone was on time.My recruiter was very unprofessional. She didn't get back to me until 1.5 months after the interview was done. I must have sent her 6 follow up emails and she didn't bother responding to any one of them. A short note asking me to wait for some more time would have been very helpful. A rule of thumb is if the recruiter isn't calling back and checking up if you have an offer at hand etc., they are not that interested in you.Note that references from engineers working in Google matter a lot. Google also does a background check if you have peers inside and you cannot lie - I was asked if I had worked with certain people already in the company. I had a nasty ex-colleague in Google who because of team dynamics was pitched as my competition (I know, petty politics!). If you have such a case, don't write his/her name.

Google,"A Google recruiter called me a few months back about having me apply for a Software Engineer position at their New York office. I was already employed in a good job at the time, so I was in two minds about exploring new opportunities. They set up a meeting for me with one of their engineers to clear any doubts or questions I may have about working at Google. This really helped with my decision to interview there, and I indicated to the recruiter that I would like to go ahead and interview with them. An on-site interview was scheduled within three weeks.The interviews started at 10:00AM at the Google offices in Manhattan (since I live in the area, I didn't need to travel, etc.), and were over by 3:00PM. There were 1-on-1 interviews by five of their engineers, each lasted about 45 minutes. One hour was set aside for lunch at the Google cafeteria (where all of the food is free and awesome), and one of their engineers was assigned as my ""host"" at the lunch to answer any questions I may have about life at Google. He also gave me a tour of their offices (which is very cool).All of the interviews were conducted in an ""interview room"" at the Google offices, which is a small meeting room consisting of a single (small) round table and a couple of chairs, a whiteboard and writing supplies. The interviewers (promptly) came to the room at their scheduled times and conducted their interviews for their 45 minutes, or until the next interviewer had arrived outside. Each of the interviews consisted of one or two math or algorithm problems. I was expected to first describe my general approach to the solution. After the interviewer was satisfied with the general approach, I was asked to write code on the whiteboard. I could use any programming language of my choice. I chose Java in almost all questions, and it seemed that most of the interviewers did their day-to-day work in C++. In any case, about half of the time was spent in the back and forth with the interviewer in coming up with the general approach to the problem -- I would come up with an approach, and the interviewer would point about certain cases that didn't work (or other conditions that needed to be met). The other half of the time was spent in planning and writing out the code on the whiteboard.Despite my background in research, none of the questions pertained to my background and experience. The questions were all designed to gauge fundamental problem-solving and algorithms expertise. It seemed like the interview questions were devised completely independently of my resume/background.Finally, during the last 15 minutes (2:45PM-3:00PM), I had a short ""debrief"" session with the HR guy, who gave me the opportunity to ask him any final questions I may have had, and to give him a little feedback about my experience that day.

Google,"Interned at Google the summer before. Loved the place. The team seemed to like me. Am graduating. Well, let's do interviews!I contacted my intern recruiter asking for a full-time job opportunity, and s/he quickly referred me to the recruiter responsible for that. Since I was a former intern my phone screen was waived (had two 45-minute screens when applying for internship), and my former intern host was asked to provide a feedback. I was asked to do a job talk (as a PhD) followed by 4 rounds of interviews, 2 research and 2 engineering.The job talk was 45-minutes followed by 15 minute questions. I was basically talking about what I did during the graduate school years, so it was quite pleasant and I was excited to see people interested in my work. After that it was a casual lunch with my intern host, so I devoted every minute enjoying the food.The two research interviews were conducted by people familiar with the field, and had challenging questions on the overall understanding. I found it very exciting as both of us would get involved into discussion about the state-of-the-art. A little coding and math details were asked, but mainly about research ideas.The two coding interviews were very standard - I did not get those very difficult questions like ""implement sudoku in 30 mins"" that someone allegedly encountered. The interviewer was constantly copying my whiteboard writings down, which created a little down time. I asked the interviewer and s/he said it was recently required and no worries. I guess if this could be disclosed by the recruiter earlier it would be better.After the interviews the recruiter followed up promptly, with accurate estimates of when I would get updates. The hiring committee approved the application in a week, followed by the final offer a few days later.Overall it is a nice experience and Google apparently provides great opportunities.",Positive Experience

I spent most of my effort preparing by searching the web for questions people were asked in the past and reviewing basic concepts. Apparently I did well enough for them to call me a year later and ask me to interview again. This time i prepared by reading the recommend Algorithm Design Manual and doing as many practice questions as possible on a white board. I used the practice questions from Cracking the Coding Interview and Programming Interviews Exposed.

The interviewers would then take you to the next one in your schedule, and they would talk about you to each other in between. FYI, if you're honest to your HR rep about any concerns you might have about the position, the other interviewers will see them and do their best to persuade you otherwise.The interview questions were not as bad as I worried - the questions were very reasonable and could definitely be done in the interview time. There were some things that they asked me about that I freely admitted to not knowing, and then they'd give me a question about it and see if I could figure things out without the prior knowledge.

They say that if you get 5 interviews and if the last one is with a senior manager, then you'd get a job. NOPE. NEVER. I got five interviews and the last one was with a very nice senior person working there for 35 years and still I got rejected.Went to Redmond a few months ago in a snowy winter day! There were five interviews:1) A very strict (but polite) person, no smile on the face, explicitly telling me that he wont help me and wont give me any hints. It was all about quickly writing a bug-free C++ code to find a pattern in a string, implementing a post order tree traversal with and without recursion and a few research/design problems.2) An extremely nice korean guy who asked about hash tables/lookup/insert/collision in HT and implementation in C++. There was another question about writing all permutations of a given string.3 and lunch interview) A very nice person, willing to help: He told me to develop an algorithm for finding whether a matrix has some properties or not. It was 5 months ago and I forgot the question. I could solve the question but he was looking for a more efficient algorithm. He was willing to help and gave me hints but time was up and he gave me to the next interviewer. he told me that I was going to the right direction.4) The fourth interviewer was very odd. I hope his behavior was planned/intentional and he is not like this. From our conversation, it was obvious that this guy is very smart. He wrote a long input string with lots of delimiters in the white board and asked me to write a c-code to change the given string it to another format based on some rules. It was a horribly vague, twisted question with lots of unknowns and exceptions. In the interview, he was taking nap time to time and he left the room at least three times. Again I hope that this was a test to see my reaction. The reason that I hope for the best is that at the end of the interview, he was the only person who gave me very honest feedbacks and compliments. But if it is not the case, that was awfully/extremely rude. So he passed me to the final interviewer...5) a senior manager, working in MS for 35 years. Very cool, very smart and very fun, It could be easily observed by the flags/decoration in the room/some wine on the table in his room!!! By the way, I didnt have any whatsoever behavioral questions during my day. So this time, he just started chatting with me which I guess was the behavioral part of the interview. Talking about everything except work, about big corporations, hacking!! and so on. It was truly an amazing experience with that person.Based on the book, I surely have gotten the job, but ....One week later, I got rejected.",Positive Experience

Free food and open bar, plus a chance to get to meet current Microsoft employees and some of your potential interviewers. It was a lot of fun, and I think helps candidates relax and gain a bit of confidence before interview day.In January, I received information and scheduling for my on-site interview.

In February I was informed the interview would consist of four 1 hour interviews, at the end of which I would find out whether or not I would be given an offer.I flew in on a Thursday, and Microsoft put on a meet-and-greet event for all of the candidates that evening. There was free food and open bar, plus a chance to get to meet current Microsoft employees and some of your potential interviewers. It was a lot of fun, and really helped me relax and gain a bit of confidence before the interview day. We were given packets that had our schedule for the next day, stating whether you would interview in the morning or afternoon group.**The Interview**We were shuttled to the Microsoft campus, where we had breakfast and a brief meeting with the recruiters before our first interview.First Interview:Met with a SDET who had been with Microsoft for over a decade, and had been a PM previously. Very friendly, asked mainly general questions about my experience, what I'm interested in, etc. Then, he asked me to design a subscription service system. After asking a few questions I found that he wanted the tech stack that I would build it on, with justifications for some of the choices. Overall, this interview went very well.Second Interview:I met with a PM who asked me some more general questions, asked me about a previous project I had worked with. No technical questions, and this interview also went quite well.Third Interview:Meeting with a SDET who asked me about past experience, how I got into software engineering (since I'm an MIS major). He then asked me how I would test the whiteboard, followed by how to test a piece of paper. Finally he asked me to write a method to remove all instances of a certain character from a string. He then modified it asking for how to remove a string of sequential characters from a string. The testing questions threw me a bit initially, but I still felt pretty good by the end of the interview.Fourth Interview:Met with an SDE who briefly asked me about my resume, then jumped into questions on OOP. Can you explain OOP to me. What is a class? What is an object? What is multiple inheritance and what are its drawbacks? Does C# or Java allow multiple inheritance? How is this problem solved? Finally she asked me to reverse a linked list, which I completely botched. I had seen it several times before, but just couldn't get the algorithm right. I didn't solve it before our time ran out, and had to leave it unfinished.At this point, I was feeling pretty nervous about my outcome. We were taken to lunch and when we returned, we were told our results would be given to us shortly. My name was called first, which I assumed meant the worst. The recruited told me, ""I hate to do this to you, but we want you to meet with one more member of the team."" I had a final interview with another SDE, he was very direct and jumped right into the technical question. I was asked to write a method to find the max int in an unordered binary tree. I nailed this question, which I think got me the offer.I was later told that they sometimes ask for an additional interview to determine fit within the team, how true this is I don't know.I then returned to the lobby to wait a bit more to hear my results, and was finally called back and told I was getting an offer.Final Thoughts / AdviceThe process is pretty intense but also very enjoyable. If you can, make sure to attend the event the night before the interview. It helps you gain confidence, because you get to see them as normal people, not some sort of mythical geniuses. Plus, by being sociable, displaying interest and being excited about the opportunity, you can put yourself in a good position with potential interviewers.

We generally started interviewing here and he asked some of my project related questions..No code here.Interview 2:My lunch interview was with this really young chap..we ate..taked generally..After lunch we walked back to his office... BAM! gives a marker pen in my hand... n acts as if he doesnt know me at all.. says How would you implement a program which would return a copy of a linked list given the head pointer of the original linked list.(Im giving away my questions coz i did not sign any NDA!).. talked it out quite a bit..developed logic from scratch, wrote pseudo-code, checked-double checked boundary conditions... got the logic approved.. said there are 2 ways to do it.iterative and recursive.. he asked which would you prefer when and why? I explained takin into consideration space, time, situation where the algo would actually be used and so on...he was happy with it.and then i coded it..done!. then he suggested another variant where every node of the linked list had a random pointer (in addition to the next pointer) which could randomly point to another node or be NULL..how would you duplicate such a linked list???? This was a little tricky...but doable..i got it right..everything went off fine.. he then takes me to the next interviewer.Interview 3:Again a young chap..asked a quick question about a past project. n then went straight to the white board... explaned in 3-4 sentences what BFS is.n then said..given a BST..how would you implement a variant of BFS wherein you print the first node... then the nodes in the next level from right to left.then the nodes in the next level from left to right..n the next from right to left and so on.. he asked me to give him data structures and the algo...quite tricky.neva saw this qs before.got stuck a lil..but he hinted me at very specific points...n i was quick to pick up on it.. i figured it out eventually..it can be done using 2 stacks.. I liked this question..then he says i have 15 mins left.n he throws another problem at me.asks me to strategize and code the following problem... usually in linked lists. whenever you create a node.you dynamically allocate some memory and attach a node..but what if you were given some preallocated amount of memory.. in an array..and each element of your array would have a pointer to a node of a linked list. how would you insert into an linked list in this case???..think about it..interesting question..I solved it.but dint have time to code itInterview 4:Really old chap..very very very experienced.. Principal Development Lead for UI in Windows 7... .he asks me about this one project i did in grad school..its was a computer vision project..i explained it on the white board..n in a way i was glad he asked that question since that was one of ma favourite projects and i did reall well in it...he liked what i said.,.. then he draws this on the board: algorithms--API--User experience.. n talks about how API's kinda join work going on in both ends.. n says there are jobs in all three fields..if given a choice..which would you prefer i said more towards the left side of the line.. n he made a note of it... then we again sat back and started talkin bout a lot of stuff..went of pretty ok.. n finally he asked me a design question.how would you implement a linked list class.. simple question..but im kinda weak in the my class design concepts having working mostly in c... but i took sum help from him and figured it out.. he was ok with it..after a while he said im done.for the day.I get back to my room at the marriott.. heavily retrospecting... i felt i performed brilliantly through the day.. trust me guys..im not being conceited here... i really felt i did well.n i cudin think of a single place where i made a crucial mistake or anythin... i did take help in a couple of occasions.. but im guessing they don hold that against you.. 2 days later my recruiter calls and says that they usually give out rejects by email.but he called me to give the news coz my decision was a tough one to make n it was real close... which i din feel was a consolation at all... i asked him for one.jus one reason/hint wateva..off/on the record...i don care...but he said its company policy not to give out feedback..... was dead disappointed with it.... took me a while to get over it,,...",Positive Experience

Oracle,"I sat for campus placement for Oracle.First round was online aptitude testquestions consisted of quant,verbal ,logical(containing flow charts with blank boxes comprehend the step from the paragraph given about it ),and technical aptitude questions (mainly from trees) and some c i/p o/p questions.each section had their own individual timing .quant was of moderate level.technical question of trees were lengthy and time taking to comprehend.Results of this was declared the same day . The company then visited the campus 1 day later.next round were 2 technical and two hr rounds.In the technical interview all the hr was seeking for was a good and innovative approach towards the problem.He was not impressed if one gave a generic solution.Some puzzles and basic ds,oops concept and os related questions were also asked. Those who cleared this round went ahead for the second round this time too optimised solutions for problems like longest palindromic substring were asked.The last round was hr round,which is the easiest among all .basic questions about you,your goals, why do you want to work with us were asked",Positive Experience
Oracle,"First round is online test based on aptitude,verbal,data structures,dbms and SQL.there was no negative markingSecond round is on technical.they asked questions on data structures. Also on project that we did. Third round is stress interview. In this they asked some puzzles. Final is hr interview just for formality",Positive Experience
Oracle,"applied through recruiter. Recruiter asked some questions about my resume, then scheduled a phone screen interview. Failed at phone screen. Question wasn't so tough, but was having a bad day. Practice basic data structures. I got a question with trees. One thing I was unprepared for was knowing my interview language well. You do not want to get hung up remembering syntax for things like creating hash tables during the interview. That stuff should be automatic.",Positive Experience

Square,"Was contacted by a recruiter and a technical phone screen was set up for me. The question was a typical coding challenge type, I would not say it was too difficult, but it did take a while for me to implement and I was only able to get it to work with some debugging help from the interviewer, who was very nice and polite and helped me along the way. Even though I didn't pass the interview, I enjoyed the coding challenge and felt proud of what I was able to complete. I would be glad to try another interview with them if given the chance.",Positive Experience
Square,"A series of interviews by phone. The first was a very basic screen followed by two technical interviews. The technical interviews were done using a web-app called coder-pad (not to be confused with codepad).The technical interviews both lasted about 1 hour with some time for Q&A. It is indeed nice to be able to run code via coderpad while working through a problem, however it can still be slightly awkward being interviewed over the phone.",Positive Experience
Square,Applied online through the website. no referral. Got phone interview a week after I applied. scheduled soon after and had the interview the following week. Phone interview was technical: 1 hr to solve a problem.,Positive Experience
Square,"Had two phone screens, the first went poorly, the second went well enough to get an on-site.On-site was nice, two interviews and lunch before a wrap-up with HR.I thought the on-site went well as I had running solutions for both interviews ( which they expect ) but I didn't get an offer.The whole process was quite streamlined overall although I'm disappointed i didn't get an offer or feedback.",Positive Experience
Square,"Squares interview process was very different than any other one I had had before for sure engineering. You will get 3 pair programming rounds, 1 system design round and 1 Q&A round (this was similar to system design but you explain a design of a recent project you did).The questions they ask for pair programming were all written by the engineers themselves so they won't be on leetcode or anything. Each question will also generally have several parts to it. You should still study it though as generally studying the algorithm should help. Everyone was very nice and it was an overall pretty painless interview process compared to other companies where I had to do technical stuff.",Positive Experience
Square,"Had an in person interview, great guy, friendly, ""chated"" for a bit about resume and the company and then was asked to implement a datastructure, I did ok on that however, after the implementation I was asked to write test cases for it, which I couldn't do. Overall great interview experience.",Positive Experience

Uber,"Screener -> In person -> PanelScreener : The recruiter asked about 5 questions, all testing Data Structure / Algorithms fundamentals such as performance time of a Hash. Diff. between Stack and Queue. Big O notation etc. I didn't clear the screener, so I can't tell you what the in person and panel interview would have involved. Good luck.",Positive Experience
Uber,Applied through employee's referral. The recruiter contacted me after 5 months (really surprised by that; thought my resume was filtered out long time ago). Went through two rounds of technical phone interviews - each only consisted of one medium question. Got the offer after a week. Great perks for the intern program.,Positive Experience
Uber,"I was contacted by an Uber recruiter on LinkedIn with a personalized email. I then did a recruiter phone screen, and then a technical phone screen. The next week I came in for a full day of interviews. I had to code an Android app in the interview, which was pretty cool and I think a good test of my engineering skills. Everyone was super friendly and I got to eat lunch with one of the Android teams. I had a great experience.After the interview the recruiter stayed in contact and worked with me to accept my offer. I went back to Uber several teams to meet with engineers to answer my questions about culture and just hangout.",Positive Experience
Uber,"Recruiter contacted to discuss if I have a suitable background. Then one telephonic interview to go through my resume and project. Some questions about debugging techniques and C++ fact checks.Then there was one take home assignment. It was to test C++ 11 skills and design skills. The assignment was about writing a data structure.Next were 5 onsite interviews. 45 Minutes each. First 2 were medium and hard array based questions. Both of them could be found on leetcode. Next was a design question. I was asked to write classes and api signatures. No implementation. Next was more about digging into resumes, coursework, projects and concepts. There were all sorts of questions relevant to computer science, but were short questions. Last one was about system details. More about what happens when you execute a program. Very fine details. More about memory access, instructions and their operands, representation of data in memory etc. The same interviewer asked me another basic question and write a code on whiteboard. It was a simple one.",Positive Experience
Uber,"Initially, I was supposed to have two interview, but I ended up having three (all phone interviews). First interview, was asked about my background and to explain a project. Then, was asked a technical question. I was contacted within 10 minutes of the interview completing for a second round interview.Had a second interview a week later in which I talked to a Development Manager. Again, was asked about my background and then to explain how I think the Uber product works and how it could be improved. Then, asked an open-ended OOD question.E-mailed my recruiter 3 days after to ask about feedback and she responded within a couple hours asking to set up one more interview.In my final interview, went straight into my coding question (OOD and implementation) and went over in time a little. Was contacted within 10 minutes to set up a time to talk the next day and received my offer.",Positive Experience
Uber,Lots of coding. Very little difficult algorithm description or anything analytic. Questions about agile development - pros and cons. Mobile development? Nothing scientifically oriented. I think that all the interviewers were managers.,Positive Experience
Uber,"Applied Online, got reply in about 2 weeks. Had two technical phone interviews followed by hiring manager interview. First two interviews weren't that hard but the first question was quite unexpected.",Positive Experience
Uber,"Talked to a number of engineers and had an opportunity to ask a number of questions. The interviewers were courteous and answered my questions candidly.

VMWare,"I have been talking with these people for a while, even before graduating. Once I am graduating, they were fast to follow up (in fact, they are the fastest to do so). However they were not pushy or anything, which cannot be said about all the employers/HR out there.The exact interview is quite fun, with interview questions being interleaved with chats about your work, their work and their short-term to mid-term focus. This gives you an idea of what you will get to work on and helps to have an informed decision. Again, many companies from my experience does not provide such information which makes a decision hard.As for interview questions, expect some of the typical coding questions with some system design questions. The latter is probably due to my area of expertise. Be prepared. There is really nothing special about coding questions. Study for it.",Positive Experience
VMWare,"Long and comprehensive interview. For a recent graduate from college, prepare to dig deep in your theoretical knowledge on computing, engineering, algorithms, software languages (both script and compile). They hire the best, and they want to make sure you qualify and can keep up with the rest.",Positive Experience
VMWare,"I sat in the VMware recruitment process through the on-campus drive. First was aptitude round which contains distinct sections. The 1st section had 10 questions of quantitative aptitude, there were 3 more sections containing OS, CN, DAA and code related questions in any 2 of the 3 languages(Java, C++, Python). There was a coding section too in which you had properly code and run your logic for a program in 30 minutes. Then there were 4 interview rounds: 2 Technical, Manager and HR round. The interviewers were friendly and did all they could to calm the candidate.From an interview perspective, students can focus on the following points:1. Programming ability: Should be able to write algorithms and convert it into ""bug-free"" code which implements what is asked.2. Data Structures: Strong hold on Linked Lists, Trees, and Graphs. (more the merrier)3. Operating Systems: the syllabus is sufficient for this. Should compulsorily focus on multi threading and concurrency.4. Basic knowledge of the company and products. Should have good knowledge about virtualization and cloud.5. Knowledge of other technologies will certainly help.6. No specific programming language requirements as such, but should be proficient in either of C/C++, Java or Python",Positive Experience

IBM,"Graduate recruiting process:1. Firsly, you need complete their given documents which will serve as you CV. It includes experience examples based on their values like Client Focus, Teamwork2. If you are successful with the CV screen, you will be sent a link for the online test which consists of numerical series (hard) and basic mathematical questions (easy-average). I believe you need to get 60-70% of questions right to pass the test.3. Last stage - assessment day in Hursley. We had to do another test (20 questions, 1 hour, tests your programming intuition but no actual programming questions). You have to prepare a presentation about yourself beforehand, and give that presentation on the assessment day to one of the interviewers. I had 3 or so group exercises: in a group decide which invention to bring to the technology fair, solve a puzzle where each team member had different clues about it, and the last one was having 3 interviewees in the room who try to answer behavioural questions one by one, and then everyone is allowed to add on that. Finally, there are 1-2 one to one interviews - mostly behavioural questions.",Positive Experience

IBM,"Online test, phone screen, and then on-site group exercises and one-on-one interviews. One-on-one interviews were very friendly. Only a little technical software stuff, no algorithm questions. Group interview was to present a plan to a client, which is pretty irrelevant, but it shows you can get on with people. Hardest bit was the online IPAT, which I would strongly recommend prepping for. Look up numerical series to get an idea.",Positive Experience
IBM,I submitted a resume through a current IBM employee. I had a brief phone interview that only briefly touched my technical experience. I then took an aptitude test and that was that. It turns out it was an easy interview because they were not looking for specific technical experience (certain programming languages or what have you) but instead looking to see if you would be able to pick up on whatever would be thrown at you once you arrived.,Positive Experience
