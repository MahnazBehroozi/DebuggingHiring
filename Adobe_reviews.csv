I interviewed at Adobe (San Jose, CA) in October 2015.","I had much higher hopes for Adobe than what I actually experienced. First I was contacted by a recruiter and asked to list my interests from high to low, then they set you up with a phone interview for ""general opportunities"" with a member of a team relevant to your experiences. I was really excited up to this point, because the person I talked to worked in a role that I was really interested in, and I thought there were opportunities for that kind of role within a team.For the onsite round, they invite you to this technical forum, which is basically another internal career fair to meet the hiring teams. You rank the teams that you're interested in, they rank you as well. The next day you only interview with the teams that chose you.They base their hiring decision off this one 50 minute interview session, and there were no openings that was relevant to my initial interest ranking to begin with.On top of that, they told us at the end of the onsite round that they were going to get back to us with a phone call ""at the end of the following week at the latest"". Friday of that week went by and I heard nothing, it was only until Thursday of the following week where I got a short, mass sent email that stated they found ""other candidates that were a greater match"", with no interview feedback or anything that was otherwise relevant to me.

Adobe,"Dec 18, 2015",Declined Offer,Neutral Experience,Easy Interview,"I applied through college or university. The process took 3 weeks. I interviewed at Adobe (San Jose, CA) in October 2015.","I got my interview through a resume drop at my university's CS career fair (for reference, my university is a top 20 CS school, top 50 overall).First part of the process was a phone screen, and was also where my apprehension began with the position I was interviewing for. The screen was about 25 minutes, majority behavioral (what would you do in this situation, past projects, etc.). The closest thing I had gotten to a technical question was an open-ended question about writing a function that returns 1 given 0 and 0 given 1 (multiple solutions). I figured they gave me a snowball because the interviewer had decided to pass on me, but lo and behold I got an email the next day for an onsite (*excited*).They flew me out to San Jose and put me up in a nice hotel. Interview process was like others have described on here: first day is a career fair/team matching event, second day is interviews. I got matched with two teams.Both interviews were with a panel of senior engineers on each of the respective teams. The first interview had a handful of technical questions, some easy and some a little tougher but no DP or intricate problems; I thought I did above average. The second interview was entirely abstract, talking about my experience on past projects, thoughts on X or Y programming language, favorite university course/data structure/hobby. Not a single technical questions, which I thought was odd for a final round.I got an offer from both teams I interviewed with, but ended up declining. From what I understand, both teams did their evaluations of me independently. The fact that team 2 had given me an offer without me having demonstrated any actual ability to code (between the phone screen and my interview with them) was a red flag for me. I use on-site interviews as a means to judge the caliber of the company I am interviewing for. While I found my interviewers very personable, the technical aspect of these interviews failed to make me feel as if I had ""earned"" the position, and overall gave me a negative perception of engineering culture at Adobe.Adobe is a cool company doing interesting work, but in the end I decided to pursue other options.",Mostly array/sorting questions. هت Answer Question

Adobe,"Oct 31, 2018",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,I applied through college or university. The process took 2+ weeks. I interviewed at Adobe.,"Talked to adobe at career fair and had on campus interview next day which was very easy. Got invited on site for their technical forum. First day is like a mini career fair with 30 teams and after that you rank the teams you want and they rank you and then you get matched with teams to interview with. Some people get 1 match others might get 5. The second day you interview with the teams. The interviews were pretty average compared to other tech companies. But unfortunately each team is usually hiring 1 person so even if you‰غھre good you might not get the job because someone else might be better. I don‰غھt really like this aspect because at most companies they will interview you and if you‰غھre good, you get hired and then they match you to a team. Most companies don‰غھt make you directly compete against other people. Whereas at Adobe, you get matched to a team and may not even get hired if you‰غھre good because your competition might also be good. Heard back next day through a very generic email that I was rejected. The forum is very organized, but the hiring process is not standard as different teams have different requirements. Partially based on luck if you get matched with an easy team and based on who your competition is."," Basic data structures, algorithms, and some networking هت Answer Question"

Interviewers were absolute stupids, i really wonder how these idiots are recruited. These people learnt by heart each and every algorithm and data structure and i am absolutely sure they cannot do anything worth full in their life beyond it. They have no idea about the process of analysis and thought. The questions were silly, but they expect to answer in 5 mins(which means you cannot answer if you do not know it already). I didn't expect they would ask silly algorithms rather than the complicated analysis of memory models, concurrent programming, PPL, TMP, RTTI, RAII, core OOPS, Design patterns. Algorithms are fine if asked and given enough time. They did just the opposite. I am absolutely ashamed to have taken this interview.
