Amazon,"Oct 10, 2014",No Offer,Neutral Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied online. The process took 2 weeks. I interviewed at Amazon (Austin, TX) in August 2014.","Initial Communication - One of their technical recruiters messaged me on LinkedIn expressing an interest in my skills. I ignored it. A couple months went by, and I decided looking for other career opportunities would be a good thing. I applied online for their Austin, TX positions. I also found a few of their technical recruiters on LinkedIn and messaged them.I got a phone call from one of their technical recruiters. She was really nice and excited to talk to me. There were a couple questions about my work experience mostly to make sure that I was who I claimed I was on paper. The next step was a timed test online that they would record in real time. She also gave me a small document that was prep for the test listing various topics that the test would include. She also claimed 'do not exceed one hour' on the timed test.To prepare for the test, I recommend googling for Amazon Test questions. They won't be exact, but you'll get in the habit of answering questions fast. The test was composed of three questions. 1) Write a series of classes for a graphics API. 2) Implement a breadth first traversal of some tree. 3) Implement a method for the fibonacci sequence.Then a couple phone calls and email exchanges. ""You Passed, we love you!"". The next step is an onsite interview that lasts 2-4 hours.The onsite interview consisted of meeting with pairs of people. One of them was the lead interviewer, the other was someone who had started within the last six months and was there more to take notes. The first group seemed unhappy to be there at all. It didn't matter what I said. It was straight to the white board for more technical tests. This group asked questions about implementing a bit map editor. They purposely would ask vague questions with the expectation that you will ask them questions to figure out what they are really wanting answered. They would ask questions about big O notation. They would ask questions about memory usage. The next group was similar.I asked each of the groups if they would be my actual coworkers. The answer was no across the board. I did want to meet whom I would actually be working with. The people I met in the interview seemed like they didn't want to be there. Toward the end of one of the groups, I thought of a better implementation to a question I answered. They responded, ""We're out of time"". They definitely had the attitude of ""People apply here everyday, Anyone is replaceable, No one is unique""I'm guessing I didn't pass their in-person technical test, but I wasn't too crazy about working with them either."," For a bitmap editor, given an x,y location and a color, write a series of methods for a Fill operation like the paint bucket, except only change the color of the outer boundary of what would be filled.   1 Answer"

No interview schedule was included, and according to one of the video they sent me, I should get the schedule in the morning from frontdesk or recruiter.When I got their office at 8:45AM (scheduled time), I ended up waited until 9AM to see my 1st recruiter. When I asked him about my schedule, he has to pull me to another recruiter and the 2nd guy pulled it up from his phone and told me there will be 5 interviews.

Amazon,"Jun 26, 2013",No Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied through college or university. The process took 4+ weeks. I interviewed at Amazon (Seattle, WA).","An Amazon recruiter came to my University to give us a spiel about working at Amazon and accepted resumes at that time. She contacted me by phone to see if I would be interested in interviewing. This was an expenses-paid trip to Seattle for a few days.The day started with a general QA session with some really nice Amazon SE Engineers. The bulk of the interview after that was a group programming project; we were given a task, split into teams of 3, and had around 6 hours to program. We were pulled out individually during that time to discuss our individual implementation and ideas. They wanted to, of course, discuss the time complexity of the implementation. I was a bit turned off by the fact that they asked 0 questions about projects we had worked on in the past or questions to learn more about us as people--but maybe they were getting some of that information just by observing how we interacted with our teammates?I personally think I flubbed this one--I got flustered at the start and it took me too long to get started. Be prepared to think through a large, complex problem that could involve a lot of programming and data structures. The problem in our case was divided into three parts--I took the third one, but I think it was more reliant on the other parts than I had anticipated. I recommend trying to pick a part of the problem that doesn't necessarily build from the other parts if you plan to ""divide and conquer"" to solve the problem.If I had to do it again, I might try a more team-oriented approach. Instead of trying to get everything implemented in such a short amount of time, work together to really iron out the implementation on paper, and THEN get started on the implementation with really well-defined (and modest) goals for each programmer. One of the reasons I didn't feel quite comfortable with this approach at the time is that one of my teammates was sort of bashing people he had programmed with in the past... and I felt uncomfortable about adding myself to his roster of bash-ees! If I do apply again in 6 months as Amazon suggested, I'll be sure to ignore such impulses and really apply myself to the idea of working as part of a team.",Large group programming project--working on a small development team and brushing up on datastructures would be helpful for preparation   Answer Question

Amazon,"Oct 30, 2013",No Offer,Neutral Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 3 weeks. I interviewed at Amazon (Seattle, WA) in October 2013.","Amazon contacted me after receiving my resume through a conference database. They asked me to complete a 90 minute online coding assessment, where I was asked 3 different (relatively simple) coding problems (eg determine whether or not a LinkedList contains a loop). A little over a week later I heard back from HR saying that I had been selected to go to Seattle for an onsite interview.The interview started at 11:45, and we were first brought into a room where we had lunch and casually talked to employees about Amazon and living in Seattle (there were about 30 of us, all students looking for post-graduation entry-level positions). Then we each were assigned an interviewer and brought to a small room with a whiteboard where I had 45 minutes to first talk about a project I had worked on/experience I'd had in school or internships. Then I was given a coding problem that I had to solve on the whiteboard. After I was finished, I had some time to ask questions of my own. There were four interviews just like this in total, in which I stayed in my room and interviewers came in and out. Two of my interviewers were very nice and helpful if I got stuck, one of them was kind of uncomfortable because I was confused about the problem and was struggling a little bit, and the other one seemed to really dislike me, looking at me like I was an idiot every time I said something or wrote something (he also tried to trip me up by saying that it was necessary to manually resize an ArrayList in Java, which I knew wasn't the case but it got me a little flustered and he told me I need to do some more research after the interview). That particular interviewer was stressful, but the other three didn't seem to want me to fail.Overall I think that the people there were pretty nice, although maybe a little bit pretentious, but it is Amazon so I suppose they have a right to be, since many many people want to work there and they have the ability to select the best of the best candidates. It was also a little weird after the interview, since my last interviewer walked me to the lobby and left and there was no further discussion or convening.

Amazon,"Feb 4, 2014",No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,I applied through other source. The process took 4 weeks. I interviewed at Amazon in January 2014.,"Amazon flew me over to interview and paid a very nice hotel. The people who interviewed me were very friendly but in a very corporate way. You could tell they were instructed to be smiley. Also, I found it a bit ridiculous that when I got the chance to ask questions about whether they felt challenged and stimulated by their job they said yes, or simply nodded in one case, with such an unconvincing facial expression (like ""I have to say yes, but I absolutely do not mean it"").I was given a document a few days before stating what I had to prepare for the interview. The document stressed that the most important thing was to prepare on algorithms and data structures and it stated clearly that no specific knowledge of databases was assumed. Well, guess what, half of the interviewers asked me about databases, so overall it did not go well...I spent several days preparing for the interview and took the time (and vacation) to go through the process. I think they should stick to what they write on their own documents. But the thing that was most annoying is that when they communicated me I was not being made an offer they sent me a copy and paste email they sent to all candidates, without even addressing me by my first name. I thought it was incredibly rude, after all the time I spent to prepare and go to the interview, that they don't take a second to make a message they send you personal.

I interviewed at Amazon (Seattle, WA) in April 2010.","I have had two interviews with Amazon recently, within a span of 20 days, both over the phone. These were mostly technical interviews. The first interview started with the interviewer asking me to explain what I am working on and why I am interested in a position with Amazon. After I described my work and interests briefly, he started to ask technical questions. To start with, the questions were on time complexity of various data structures (arrays, vectors, linked lists, hashes) for accessing/inserting/deleting an item. Then he asked me a question about the difference between a thread and a process and some multi-threading concepts such as shared resources and semaphores. Finally the focus shifted to algorithms and the questions were mainly on finding the most frequent word(s) in a large file and efficient algorithms to do so. In the end he asked me to code up a program in my preferred language (C) to find the second maximum element in an array in linear time. I submitted the code by the end of the day. In summary, the interview went pretty good and I received an invitation for a second interview within a week.The second interview also started in a similar way as the first one except that the person interviewing me gave a slightly better description of the kind of work in the position I was being interviewed for. Without spending too much time on this though, he started with technical questions by first asking me about what languages and platforms I used for programming. He then asked a few questions about efficient ways to merge sorted sub-arrays into one large sorted array (merge sort) followed by a hash-table question involving chaining to overcome collisions.

Amazon,"Mar 24, 2009",No Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 3 days. I interviewed at Amazon (Seattle, WA) in July 2007.","The recruiter from Amazon.com called me and asked for an interview. I agreed on a date which would be in about a week as I was involving with my current job at the moment and needed time to finish it. I however had to postponed the intervieew to a few days later. The lady on the phone was very nice and helped me pick the date I would be avaible. My first impression with Amazon.com was their recruiting staff were very professional and knew what they were looking for.The first interview on phone went fine for me. The interviewer seemd to be an senior engineer and he asked me mostly about application concurrency and load perfermance. I hadn't done much parallel programming since leaving colleage but I managed to get over with what I'd done and read so far. Oh, and I remembered he also asked me to provide a pseudo implementation for some algorithm that we discussed during the interview. I did it nervously as well as reluctantly as I wasn't comfortable with this kind of on-the-phone-programming. He said I made it right eventually. So, that was the first interview.The second one happened a few days later. This time the guy was an old one and pretty easy going. Some of his questions were just like those in my previous interview. He actually told me that he didn't have much else to interview me. And we ended up talking about the weather, drinks... stuff like that. It was a fun and easy one.The third one, still on the phone, was supposed to be with an American. Instead, it was an Indian guy and this was where I screwed up. I'm not sure if it was because we both spoke English as a second language or I just sucked that day, we misunstood during the whole session. The guy eventually asked me to implement an algorithm in Java, which I very much hate as I couldn't express everything I wanted over the phone. So, we ran out of time and he asked to instead send an email with the code attached. A few days later, the same lady that had been contacting told me that they were not interested and would be looking for other candidates. I thanked her and the crew for spending time with me.My overall perception with Amazon.com was very good and still is. Their interviews though were kinda weird and somehow wasted of time. Why needed 3 phone interviews, especially the programming through the phone part ? Many people are not comfortable with it, and they absolutely can cheat. I am told of stories about Indians having their friends doing the programming for them because they sound all the same over the telephone.One more thing they could probably improve is to have native English speaking people do the interviews. No offense at all to Indians, but as many candidates are also international, so the comunication could be very misleading on the phone. My Indian friends even told me that some Indian interviewers would try to make the candidate look like a fool to show that they are better, especially when their bosses are also on the line. It seemed true in my last interview. But again, this is not common.So, that is my experience with Amazon.com. I'm still working in the same company, but in a Data Warehouse project.

Amazon,"Mar 7, 2011",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"I applied through an employee referral. The process took 3 weeks. I interviewed at Amazon (Seattle, WA) in December 2010.","The phone screening was pretty easy, a question involving linked lists - given 3 linked lists, find if there are any combinations that add up to zero if you take 1 element from each list.The on-site interview was odd - EVERY interviewer asked me a variation of the same question, given a 2x2 array and a single element, search all the neighbors for some condition. An example of this type of question is to implement the flood fill algorithm for a paint program. The answer to this is in the book, ""Cracking the Coding Interview"", page 175.The ""bar raiser"" interview was not what i expected. I expected to get some really tough problem to solve. Instead, the interviewer started out by asking me to talk about a past project I was really proud of, and explain why. Then he spent the next 30 minutes trashing my work, forcing me to defend it. I don't know how this raises the bar of people coming into the company, but I felt this approach was very disrespectful, and would not want to work in an environment where that was the norm. He then gave me 10 minutes to code another version of a flood-fill like algorithm.One of the things I noticed during the whiteboard coding questions is that they obviously take the code you write during the interview very seriously. Each interviewer was writing down every line of code verbatim (I imagine it becomes part of the interview record). Because of this, make sure you write very clean code, write it correctly the first time, and try to be as linear as possible. I sensed that revisiting earlier parts of the code - even adding a variable at the top - frustrated some of my interviewers, because they had to go back and cross something out (most were writing on a pad of paper).My advice to people going in to interview at Amazon is to prepare really well. Not only should you work through the book I mentioned above, but do some research online about Amazon culture (it's not for every one), and decide if you want to be a part of that culture. If the answer is yes, be prepared to demonstrate in the interview how you will fit in.",Implement the floodfill algorithm of a paint program   2 Answers

I submitted my resume via email and was scheduled for a phone interview within the week. A few hours before the interview I received an email stating they needed to postpone it until the next week.I finally received the call after 7 days of waiting and proceeded with the phone screening. The interview was being conducted by one of their developers, so the expectation of technical knowledge was high. He was courteous and friendly but immediately got down to business with the first questions. The interview consisted of a few short-answer questions and several more open-ended problems dealing with algorithms and software design. The questions were fair and not overly difficult, and the interviewer offered a few hints and nudges in the right direction when I got stuck on something.I've heard from others that there is something of an ""Amazon culture"" of cockiness and a general attitude of being the best at what they do (which certainly may be well deserved judging by the size and success of the company). I did get something of a sense of this when I was asking my questions at the end of the interview--when I asked the developer what his favorite part about working at Amazon was, he immediately replied that it was the confidence that he could solve virtually any problem posed to him, no matter how large.

It was a pretty typical interview process - one or two initial phone screens (both technical and HR) followed by a heavy technical on-site all-day interview.The phone screensThe initial phone screens were quite straightforward. A few HR questions followed by some technical questions. I had two phone screens and both times, the interviewers left me with homework to do (i.e. code out my solution and send it to them).The technical on-site interviewI think this is pretty typical for all-day on-sites, but my day started at 8:30am and I interviewed straight until 6:30pm (10 hours, minus half an hour for lunch). I saw 8 people in total, interviewing for anywhere from 30 minutes to 90 minutes each. The questions ranged from simple logic, to hardcore graph and dynamic programming algos, and even some math and graphics questions. Again, though, at the end of the day, I had more homework to do.I think that the homework questions are fine and I agree that it adds rigor to the process, but I had a total of 3 homework questions, and they weren't trivial. I spent at least 4 hours on each, and so it was quite time-consuming considering this is OUTSIDE of the slotted interview times.

It started off with basic Java/Object Oriented questions, and then moved to many performance related questions (Big O), such as the Big O of Java collections objects. There is also coding on a shared screen towards the end of the interview, and the interviewer would ask you to optimize the performance of your code. The second interview was similar to the first in terms of question structure. However, this interviewer had a heavy accent, so it was a bit difficult to understand some of the questions. In addition to the coding on a shared screen, this interviewer also had you give pseudocode over the phone for another exercise. After hearing that they were not going to proceed with the face to face interview in Seattle (with no reason given), I was contacted another 5 times within the next month and a half by other people recruiting full time positions for Amazon.

Amazon,"Feb 3, 2012",Declined Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 6 weeks. I interviewed at Amazon (Seattle, WA) in October 2011.","3 Phone Screens + 1 in-house interview dayFirst phone screen: Development Manager position. I felt like I did good enough to warrant further consideration, but I knew I wasn't likely the best software manager candidate they ever interviewed. Interviewer was professional and friendly. He indicated there would be more screening.Second phone screen: Senior Development Manager position. Interviewer was a very senior director level manager of a large organization within Amazon. When answering questions about about project scheduling and live site issues, I failed to realize that Amazon's highest priority is keeping their existing services working perfectly and that trumps any new development. If I had recognized that part of their business before the call, I may have given more impressive answers.Third phone screen: Software engineering (individual contributor position). This was a very comfortable interview for me. Mostly all technical and programming questions. I knew I had done well when I got off the phone.Between each phone screen, a few weeks would go by without hearing anything. I would wait at least a week and then politely email the recruiter about next steps. Each time, the recruiter would apologize for the delay and setup the next phase (which would usually be for the subsequent week). Treat those Amazon recruiters nicely - Amazon is going through a huge growth spurt right now and their recruiters have way too many positions to fill to give anyone individual attention. So if you get anxious, wait at least a week, and send very short and professional mails to the recruiters asking about next steps. They are good about following up to any email you send within a few days.In person interview: 6 hours of interviews. This included 4 separate hour-long interviews of coding and design problems on the white board. I felt like I did very well."," I won't give away the questions asked, as that would violate the NDA I signed. (Because I might actually want to work there some time down the road...)But I will say this: Almost every coding and design question asked has been posted on Glassdoor. While I am a very experience programmer, I recognized long before the interview process, that I would need to put in some long hours preparing for this company. I spent a lot of time spent refreshing myself on data structures and applying that to problem solving. I went through like fifty Amazon programming questions posted here. I copied each one down, and made a note of the number of times an equivalent variation of that question was posted. Then I made sure I could solve each one with my own code. Extra attention given to the problems posted multiple times.Prior to my interview, I had heard from many friends who interviewed at Amazon that they were asked at least one question involving a hash table. Amazon is famous for asking questions about hash tables. Either they ask about the hash table constructs in various programming languages (like Java and Perl, hash vs. map, etc..), or a coding problem where the hash table affords an O(N) or O(1) solution. So if you are asked a question that involves looking up a value in one array and searching for a corresponding value in the same or other array - the answer likely involves ""use a hash table"".Also, Amazon quizzes candidates on their ability to recognize runtime ordering of the coding solutions.

Amazon,"Mar 23, 2012",No Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 4+ weeks. I interviewed at Amazon (Seattle, WA) in September 2011.","Was cold-called by internal recruiter who was following-up for a tech manager who had seen my online resume. Recruiter strangely was more comfortable with phone than email, so our exchanges took a long time to transpire. My background is User Interface Development, which is all over my resume, so I assumed the position was related given the tech manager's interest, though I didn't expressly hear this from the recruiter.Eventually we setup a phone interview between a developer and myself, and I was caught off-guard by a series of backend software engineering technical questions. The interviewer was very nice, and we worked through many of the questions together, but I constantly made mention that these were not the sorts of things I deal with in the work I do. The interviewer was decent throughout the process, especially given my bickering about the lack of relevance to my background.I emailed the recruiter after the interview describing the awkward interview situation. I was surprised to hear back that I passed and was being asked to conduct another technical phone interview. I wrote back stating I would be happy to but only if it was more related to my industry background, which I described in more detail to the recruiter. Oddly, after that I received a curt reply back stating that they no longer wanted to proceed with the interview process. The recruiter just ended it there and did not even try to find me a position or group with a better fit within the company.In short, the recruiter was not very professional but I felt the developer who interviewed me was."," Questions were in the category of data structures and algorithm --- e.g., searching algorithms, big-O, caching implementations.   Answer Question"

I was able to answer both questions (that is, I produced a viable way to do both within given restrictions that he mentioned). One difference between this and the previous interview was that the person was rushing very quickly, and literally tried hanged up when the 45 min mark was up (not even asking questions, just saying ""if you have any questions, simply contact the recruiter"").

Amazon,"May 12, 2013",No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 3 weeks. I interviewed at Amazon (Seattle, WA).","Recruiter contacted me through linked in, gave me an initial coding test. After that a phone screen, which was primarily technical (count number of bits set in an integer value, quick OO design question, quick leandership question, etc.). After that I was requested to come on site for job interviews. Through the process I worked with three separate recruiters (all of whom annoyingly asked for my resume with nearly every correspondance).The onsite interview was difficult. Basically, I was grilled by five separate groups of people (there's typically the interviewer, and then some trainee in the room), asking to whiteboard algorithms, functions and designs on a whiteboard. Most people were polite, although the constant typing whenever you're speaking (and sometimes at moments where you don't understand why they'd type) is annoying and distracting. By the fifth hour (seriously...) of interviewing....I was just mentally out of steam. I didn't even get significant breaks between these interviews, so by the last one I would have killed somebody for a glass of water (possibly a breath-mint, much to my disdain)Frankly, this process was a big turn off for me. Enough so that I left that afternoon seriously wondering if I was a good fit for the company. Equally distressing were the calls the subsequent week I received from the interviewer at 6 PM (or later) their time....that does not bode well.I think their interview process selects heavily towards those with strong CS fundamentals (which I agree, is important) and good memorization skills, but it really has no deference for work ethic, passion about technology, ability to deal with really hard problems (let's be honest: nothing you solve in the real world can be white-boarded in twenty minutes), ability to think outside the box (none of the questions or algorithms requested were particularly interesting or difficult--datastructures 101 fodder, for the most part) or sound judgement. It's more just a set of technical flaming hoops with some weird leadership stuff tossed in the fray.I ultimately was not extended an offer; they give no feedback as to why, which is somewhat irritating but probably par for the course. That said....I had some sense of relief that I didn't get one, and didn't have to consider the company after the interview process.",The initial coding test was by far the most difficult--involved finding n highest ranked films in a network of similar films.

The whiteboard was not especially large so it was difficult to fit all the code, especially since I tend to write some code, notice that I forgot something, go back and add a line, etc.The second interview was strange because the interviewer asked me two coding questions and then seemed to be working on his computer while I wrote each answer on the whiteboard. At first I thought maybe he was copying down my code but he did a lot more typing than I did scribbling. He also didn't seem to pay any attention to what I was doing until I finished writing and explained what I had done. Seemed rude and a waste of everyone's time (especially considering I drove 2 hours each way to the interview). We could have achieved the same result by having me just submit answers via email. For the second question, I couldn't fit the entire answer on the whiteboard so I had to erase and continue. By the time I had finished the scribbling exercise there wasn't time to improve my algorithm or discuss anything.I wasn't too disappointed when I didn't get an offer."," Do a deep copy of a linked list in which each item, in addition to the normal ""next"" pointer has a random pointer to another item in the list.   2 Answers"

Amazon,"Aug 12, 2012",No Offer,Neutral Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 6 weeks. I interviewed at Amazon (Seattle, WA) in July 2012.","I've done at least three different sets of Amazon phone interviews over the years and to my surprise, I actually made it through the phone screen process on this last try and made it to the doors of Amazon.com in downtown Seattle.Now about the actual interview process: I did two phone interviews over a 2 - 3 week period, and then another 2 - 3 weeks to get around to the actual in-person interview (in other words, Amazon wasn't in any major hurry). I felt the phone interviews (talking on the phone while furiously typing into a collabedit web site) were far more stressful than the on-site interviews, although all of the interviews were quite intense, technically. The recruiting coordinator is not the same person as the H.R. person who you'll meet during the interview (although in my case, I got to meet both). The H.R. lady was as cold and generic as they come, informing the candidates up front that Amazon is a ""no feedback"" company (which -- to their credit -- is a lot more honest and open about not providing constructive comments, versus most every other employer who just will say ""we've decided to go forward with other candidates"" and leave it at that).My interview day was scheduled to go from 9:30 until about 1:30 p.m. and they attempt to keep to that schedule and they won't do ""bonus"" (additional) interviews tacked on at the end of an exhausting day like Microsoft will do. In my case, I did at least three technical rounds with at least two of them being ""tag team"" interviews (two interviewers quizzing me at the same time).The first set was a project manager with a senior software engineer mostly listening in. Their question consisted of ""design a restaurant reservation system"".The second set of tag team interviews was a senior software engineer (probably the one I would have worked closest with) along with a teenage software intern along to watch the ritual candidate slaughter. In this case, because this particular senior engineer was closest to my background and my specialty, I felt like I was able to relate to him best and explain myself properly, as I worked up and white-boarded out a nice architecture-specific feature-enhancement for the product I think they had me in mind to work on.The third interview was a manager who was unexpectedly pulled into speaking with me when my originally arranged interviewer got held back on some unknown something. He made sour faces at my dense resume as he paged through it, since he had no time to prepare for speaking with me, he didn't ask me any memorable questions about my background, and I felt like this conversation was almost as uncomfortable as….…. the lunch interview with the hiring manager. A week prior to my interview day, the recruiting coordinator e-mailed a menu and asked me to make a selection for a box lunch. I chose what I felt would be a safe choice (salad, so as to not be tired from a full stomach), but in retrospect, I probably should have chosen nothing at all. Because when I wanted to talk with the hiring manager & find out more about the big picture of the business, either he was eating or I was eating something, and one of us had our mouths full and it just wasn't the engaging conversation I wanted to have with the person who was going to potentially sign the dotted line to me getting hired. What would have been preferable would be for me to go to lunch on my own (just to collect my thoughts or regroup) or go to lunch with somebody -- or some host -- who has no up or down vote at all in the process (which is what Google does with their candidates).The last technical round I had with was an analytics guy, sent in to test my general data structures and algorithms background. He had me drawing trees on the white board and then describing rules to determine whether a flipped tree was equivalent to another tree. It was pretty clear from the tone of the conversation that he was going to be a thumbs down.In any event, I didn't go to Seattle expecting an offer and sure enough, the H.R. bot lady called two days after the interview to say ""we've decided to go forward with another candidate"". But like the Olympics, I am honored just to do these interviews and consider these fly-outs as an opportunity for me to exercise my (apparently out of shape) general comp sci technical muscles. Almost everyone I spoke with at the technical level was very recently out of school, so it may be that Amazon only prefers candidates who are book smart and not necessarily engineers who have built a portfolio of successful & shipping products. If you score an interview at Amazon, pat yourself on the back because at least you get to compete. Don't go in expecting to actually win a prize."," Given two sets of trees and ignoring the content of the nodes, describe rules that would define whether or not these two trees are equivalent.   3 Answers"

However, the onsite interview went downhill really fast.    The interview was constructed heavily focused on behavioral questions, even though the hiring manager explained at last coding was the dominating factor. I knew I didn't perform well and probably wouldn't get an offer, but still there were several red flags would make me walk away even an offer was extended.    Several interviewers were very distracted and rude. When I answered that my former coworkers were very helpful and nice to me and each other, the manager did not just disbelieve me, but was snarky and laughed about it, which made me a bit shocked but since that was the first round, I didn't really think that much.    The second interviewer was checking her phone and emails all the time while I was coding and talking through, so I had to go back and explain everything all over again, yet she told me I misunderstood the question even though I did draw out the solution, explained details and even asked her ""permission"" to code it up. But that's fine, since it took two people to misunderstand each other, and it did show my communication skill was not that strong.    The lunch session was a disaster, the guy was talking on his phone and then texting while leading me the way to the lunch place, and I had to pace up and ask him all sorts questions. Same situation continued through the whole lunch, it was either me asking questions, him texting, or awkward silences. I mean if one was so not welcoming and interested into a candidate, just don't waste other people's time. During the lunch, I confirmed all of them would be on the same team where the position was, and that was the moment I decided to pass even got an offer.    After that I just didn't care anymore, and all the interviewers asked about situations of ""pushing back"" coworkers, not once, all of them, and some even asked multiple times with different wording. I just wonder what would it be like to work on that team. I mean, I get it, it's Amazon, and people are ""smart"" there. But being snarky, arrogant, rude and disrespectful are totally irrelevant.

I thought I would have a good chance at getting an interview, considering a colleague of mine with the same college education and work experience (we were at the same job out of school) was hired there, but it wasn't enough. The lack of communication makes me question whether or not the company would have been a good place to work, because I can't imagine how frustrating it would be to deal with others in the organization that just refuse to answer you when you reach out to them.I reached out to Amazon several times:1. I reached out to a friend who was working at Amazon. He told me he gave it to his manager. I badgered him weekly for over a month before he told me that his manager didn't have a job to offer after all. That's ok, but it took a long time to hear back.2. I reached out to a previous recruiter. This recruiter said that she would see if she had anything available. I emailed her to check in every week or two, but she never got back to me.3. I found a job through the Amazon Jobs site and applied through email, because their application website was not working. After two to three weeks I heard back from someone, who said a member on their team would reach out to me. I waited two weeks before emailing her again, stating that no one got in touch with me. She told me a different member of her team would reach out to me. I waited another two weeks before trying to contact the person directly, which failed. Finally, after emailing the job recruiter again, she told me that the team decided not to go forward with my resume. I asked if they could tell me why, so that I could improve my resume, and I was told that they couldn't get me that information.3.5 Several people reached out to me about jobs that would have required relocation.

Was given a coding challenge at HackerRank, which was moderate, but practical.Eventually was invited to on-site interview in Seattle, where I had all day long interview.I was under strong impression everything went well. Just one thing was suspicious - all interviewers were young, and when I asked about average team age - they mentioned a number below 30. Taking into account they work 10+ hours a day, they definitely don't want to consider family guys of age around 40. That's my best guess. Worth to mention I was watching for people coming in and out and they were pretty young too, that is also why my guess can be right. Obviously I did not feel as I'm a good fit for them because of that.Having previous successful interview experiences with other companies like Microsoft, I can imagine these guys are looking for young slaves. Given that they don't pay above the market, I see no reasons to go there unless you don't want to loose your family or you are a single work-addicted person.To contrast - Microsoft and Facebook interviews were fair, practical and they are giving some details on where you failed (if you failed).

I asked if he wants some specifics instead of whole life story and that helped to not waste our time on staff that is irrelevant at this step.Next was the problem, it was easy problem, described below. I explain exactly the algorithm as it was stupid easy. The only issue I had was that it is in a text editor and day-to-day work you use some IDE that gives you all functions of each object you use. In particular I needed to sort() and I could not remember if the sort function takes call back, lambda or something else in the language I used for the interview. I was recently working with several different languages and each has different syntax for sort. The interviewer did not like that. The I said that I think it takes lambda function with 2 args and returns true/false. He googled and it was not the case for this language. Oh well, I never met a developer who is not using Google nor StackOverflow every day.Another thing is that the interviewer was going on silent and when I had a question he probably was somewhere else and did not answer several times..Finally at the end he asked if I have questions. I actually wanted to learn more about Amazon. However, he answered first 2 questions in short sentences and then pretty much let me know he does not want to talk any more.Summary: I agree that developers should be tested on algorithm implementation. However, if real IDE is not used then it needs to be in a pseudo language because in nowadays it is pointless to remember all syntax sugar of each language, - IDE does it for you, the same way as we do not code in assembly any more.",Split string by letters and count how many times each letter appear there.   2 Answers

He finally gets through on the third attempt.- My interviewer didn't have good communication skills and seemed like he was in a rush to get to other things. He also failed to really describe the position in any real detail.- We used an online collaborative code editor which initially went down for a couple of minutes but then came back up. Once it did, the highlighting it had on my cursor gave me a lot of trouble writing code.- I worked through his 2 coding questions after about 45 mins.

I interviewed at Amazon (Seattle, WA) in March 2017.","I did not get the job, so you might want to take what I say with a grain of salt. The interview was with Amazon.com, the job was writing monitoring system to prevent faults within their systems. I did not really get the impression that their engineering groups are all that great at this. While everyone seemed competent at their job, they all seemed to be under immense pressure. This was further underlined for me when at lunch the TPM told me that her ideal staffing for the team was 14 and there was no way she could really expect more than 2 or 3 engineers. When there is such a disconnect between what they are able to get and what a PM thinks is ideal, there's a problem. I can understand why they will want to hire tens of thousands of engineers in the future. It seems to me that there is no overall understanding of their architecture. Everyone seems perpetually confused by the fact that hardware is not 100% reliable. More than one person mentioned something like ""Well, we can be sending packets but if the other end isn't listening what do you do?"" It seems that a single hard drive filling up caused an entire AWS data center to go down. I simply am unable to understand how this could have happened, it is not all that difficult to come up with engineering solutions that are near infinitely-scalable, especially with the amount of money and theoretical engineering talent they have. I would guess that their fundamental problem is that they do not understand the difference between good coding and good engineering, and their solution is to keep throwing more code at it in the hope that that is the solution.If you get an offer, I would recommend you take it, simply because they have lots of money and you will get the opportunity to write good code.

I was assured that ""if the first opportunity does not work, we'll line you up with the remaining opportunities in the same region"".The confirmation date/time with the Engineer took one and a half weeks but it's perfectly reasonable during this Holiday season.The code challenge itself was frustrating because although I provided the correct answer I was still nervous, and did my best to present a good impression of my skills and experience. During the code challenge I told the Engineer I was uncomfortable.The stated focus in this challenge was ""working the problem"" than ""finding the correct answer"". I'm proud to have done both and am still baffled as to why the interviewer thought I was not a good fit. I showed the correct amount of determination even if I had to refactor many parts over to find the solution.I feel like this interview process treated me as a commodity rather than a valuable asset to Amazon. Consider these points:1. The Recruiter did not set up which opportunity I wanted - argued against my preferred choices, told me I was a perfect fit for something else. To Amazon: Please re-train Recruiters to consider applicants' goals over their interpretation of company objectives.2. The Engineer conducting the code challenge was communicative but also ""busy"". It was near the Holiday season and perhaps his rushed mentality did not see both the talking points and final solution I provided. The Holiday season is busy for everyone but attention must be given if you conduct an interview.In summary I'm just confused why an applicant that communicates a 100% correct verbal and written answer that works is not considered for the next step in the process.

Amazon,"Aug 3, 2009",No Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,"The process took 1 day. I interviewed at Amazon (New York, NY) in July 2009.","t’s been almost a year since I had my interview for a summer internship at Amazon.com, but the memory is still fresh in my mind. I went in fairly tense, excepting a Microsoft-attack-style of interviewing, but I was pleasantly surprised to be greeted by a nonchalant employee with his feet up the table chewing on a pen. Over the rim of his framed glasses, he introduced himself and asked me to have a seat, which I did.Little did I know that the first guy was actually one of a bar-raiser. Since the term is public knowledge, it can’t hurt to say that a bar-raiser is an Amazon interviewer dedicated to hiring only the best of the best candidates. A bar-raiser’s job is to go for those candidates that are somehow more special than even a “good” one.We engaged in a little chit chat about my resume and life at Cornell before launching into the interesting part of the interview, which was the coding question. It was a basic one involving a special case of the subset sum problem (which is NP complete in the general case). It went like this:    Given an array of integers or other numbers (reals, doubles, etc), tell us if any two of the numbers in the array sum up to another given number.There’s an n2 solution in which you compute all the possible pairs of numbers and then add them together to test the termination condition. Obviously, this is less than ideal. However, it is well known that integers can be sorted in O(n) time, where n is the number of integers to sort. Therefore, I proposed this additional precondition:    Allow the list of integers to be sorted in natural order before calling this methodThe algorithm then is quite simple: keep an index at the far left side, and the far right side. If the indices become equal, or cross, we’ve failed to find a pair that works. To try to exhaustively find a matching pair, we try adding the numbers at our indices. If the sum too big, we decrement the right index. If the sum is too small, we increment the left index. If the sum is equal to what we’re looking for, we can return true. Pseudocode resembling Java might look like this:    public boolean inArr(int [] arr, int sought) {      int left = 0;      int right = arr.length - 1;      while(left < right) {        int test = arr[left] + arr[right] - sought;        if(test > 0) {          right--;        } else if(test < 0) {          left++;        } else {          return true;        }      }      return false;    }Other questions would all be basic algorithms and OOP ones that simply want to establish that you can write decent code, think on your feet, and love what you’re doing.",what's your shortcomings?   Answer Question

Amazon,"Oct 20, 2011",No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied online. The process took 2 days. I interviewed at Amazon (Slough, Berkshire, South East England, England (UK)) in October 2011.","After applying online, I waited 30 days before being requested for an interview by an Amazon recruiter and I was set up for two phone interviews. The first interview went very well, although at times the questions were so vague that I felt like I would have to use divine power to come up with the answer that would match the question. For instance, rather than a straight forward 'what is unit testing?', I was instead asked 'what is a way to ensure that changes to a function will not have negative impact on other functions?' For me the answer is documentation - because that's how I write good conforming code that doesn't need unit testing in the first place, but go figure. Overall though, I was happy with the first interview, particularly as he made an effort to get to know me and I felt that I did well.The second interview was poor and the interviewer's style was frustrating. For example, 'how would you reverse a linked list?'. I provided a correct answer. 'What if there were no prev pointers?' I provided a correct answer. 'What if the list was so long that you can't use a memory buffer?' At that point I was annoyed... if the list is potentially that long then I would obviously put back the prev pointers. For me, an O(n^2) solution is not a solution at all. But that's not the game they want you to play.The worst part was when I gave a correct solution on how to find a common ancestor in a binary tree, but he thought it was wrong. I explained it again and it seems he understood, but then said 'are you sure that will work in all cases?' Yes, I said, I was very sure! I had drawn a binary tree diagram and tested enough cases to be absolutely positive it was correct. I even used the slowest, most reliable solution possible to avoid a repeat of the linked list annoyance that he had given me earlier. I had to keep convincing him before he eventually said 'well, let's move on'. Imagine how that felt.At that point I practically had to give up on the guy because it is annoying enough to get a couple of answers wrong but then also have your correct answers considered wrong as well! This did not leave a good impression on me, particularly knowing I would have to work with this guy. A few other questions seemed quite bizarre, but this report is long enough already.Unfortunately the recruiters also left an extremely poor impression - I would expect a phone call in the next 24 hours afterwards and then a follow up call after an official decision had been made. Instead I got a cut and paste message that wasn't even correct for my circumstances.Good luck Amazon.

He sounded like he was in a bit of a rush as he told me he had a meeting to go to afterwards, and our conversation was wrapped up quickly. But I continued to work on the code afterwards and after he came back online and saw me, he very generously continued to guide me through it and after a while I got just about everything right.

Amazon,"Apr 11, 2012",No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 5 weeks. I interviewed at Amazon (Toronto, ON (Canada)) in April 2012.","I was contacted by a recruiter, she asked me questions about my experience, was friendly and attentive to details. Then we set up time for a ""Coding Excercise"".Coding Excercise:1. Write a parser for a simplified regular expressionOn an alphabet set [a-z], a simplified regular expression is much simpler than the normal regular expression.It has only two meta characters: '.' and '*'.'.' -- exact one arbitrary character match.'*' -- zero or more arbitrary character match.Note that it is different from the normal regular expression in that '*' is on its own and does NOT act as a decorator on the leading character, I.e. in our simplified regular expression. ""*"" is equivalent to "".*"" in regular expression.2. Write up an analysis on the run-time complexity of your code.There was 1 - 1.5hour time limit. I was a bit stressed with this time line and wrote a code that was just replacing ""*"" with "".*"" and processing the result with java String matcher. Later i realized that they probably wanted me to write an actual parser from scratch, but it was too late... Anyway , this did not get me a face-to-face interview when Amazon representatives were in Toronto, but still they gave me an opportunity with the phone interview 2 weeks later.First phone Interview:The interviewer was nice, she asked some questions on my experience, and some Java - related questions, then she gave me a coding exercise:Print collection of words by groups where each group consists of words which are anagrams of each other. We talked about several approaches and she gave me a hint on sorting all words, and then it was easy to put all words in a map where each key is a sorted signature of all words in the group. So I just appended them all in one string per group, and was done. It took 1 hour. So thus I was granted a second phone interview.Second phone interview:Interviewer asked some questions on Java Collections Framework, then asked to do a coding excercise:Print a binary tree by levels of depth   7  5 82 6 9 (it's pretty easy when you think calmly, but at the time I was stressed because screen on my laptop suddenly flipped upside down - it's a new Windows feature, on Ctrl-Shift-Arrow Down) and I did not know how to put it back at the time, so even though the interviewer offered me an option to write my code on paper, I did not solve the question. Alas! But later wrote to the HR who scheduled my interviews, and asked for another chance because of this ""accident"", and they kindly gave me another chance in 2 weeks.Another Second Phone interview:The same interviewer as last time, asked me to write ""get (int i)"" and ""put(int i)"" methods to operate with a queue-like collection, which can hold only 3 numbers, so when you put a new number in the end of the list, one old number must be removed, which should to be the least recent requested number by ""get"" method.So if you have a list of numbers (A):237and the list of numbers requested by ""get"" method (B):13294the least recent requested number was ""1"",but when you put new number ""5"" in the list A, you must have a result375because 2 is the least recent requested number.I got a wrong impression at first that parameters in ""get"" and ""put"" methods are indexes, so after I wrestled about 20min with a logic, I had to clarify that those parameters were actually values, not indexes. I wrote my solution. But when we started to apply a test example, turned out I did not caught the case when some number in the middle of line A is not in the line B (was never requested). I started to think where in the code is better to apply this condition, but time was already up, so i could not finish it properly. The interview lasted 1 hour.I still think that a developer should have a time for careful thinking about optimal solution, rather then be requested to quickly pull out from his memory all possible tasks and solutions. I still wonder what would happen if I had an extra 10 min to complete a solution. Because when you trying to come up with solution under pressure, you don't think of considering and preventing all possible scenarios - you just glad that you came up with something without logical contradictions.So I did not get past that ""Second Phone Interview"", but overall I consider my experience as ""positive""."," write ""get (int i)"" and ""put(int i)"" methods to operate with a queue-like collection, which can hold only 3 numbers, so when you put a new number in the end of the list, one old number must be removed, which should to be the least recent requested number by ""get"" method.So if you have a list of numbers (A):237and the list of numbers requested by ""get"" method (B):13294the least recent requested number was ""1"",but when you put new number ""5"" in the list A, you must have a result375because 2 is the least recent requested number.   1 Answer"

I was having trouble understanding what he was saying on the phone. I was like hearing 20% of the words he spoke and tried to fill/guess the rest of sentence. Nearly the whole interview was spent on him repeating the things he said, as I was kindly telling him that I understand nothing. About 30 minutes had passed when he successfully asked his first technical question. It was a really bad experience. I told about this to the recruiter and I was scheduled a third phone interview.The third one was pretty much like the first one. Straight technical question. I did pretty well; analyzed the problem, thought it through, spoke out loud, came up with an efficient algorithm, checked for corner cases, commented on the running time and space complexity and mentioned other possible ways of doing it.

The interview topics were mainly about : 1- System design 2- OOP 3- Algorithms 4- Data Structureseach interview consisted of 2 parts ( personal experience - technical questions ).the interviews were above average and i can say even difficult.After a couple of days i got an email from the recruiter saying ( Congratulations offer extended )so i passed the interviews and i was waiting for the offer, she asked me for free time slot to make a call with me and give the offer, i gave her ""a lot of time slots"", nevertheless she kept stalling me for ""3 weeks""!! pretending that she must arrange a free time with another recruiter in Berlin in order to make the call.Lastly i sent her an email informing her that i'll be on vacation for 2 weeks and i'd be unavailable during it. So she scheduled a call with me the day before my vacation.Then she called me at 21:30 and said : ""We are sorry we can't offer you a position currently since we are doing restructuring and we are in hiring freeze !!!!!!!!"" , i asked about the timeline for this restructuring then she said ""maybe more than a year !!!!!!!"".I was totally shocked, Amazon has just wasted 3 months of my life between preparing, tests, interviews and waiting for phone calls.I sent an email to my recruiter and to the recruiting manager in Berlin asking for the real reason behind this, since it makes no sense that Amazon would make such a huge hiring event and bring tens of people from Seattle just to stop the process after 10 days ?? But of course no one replied to my questions.As of my opinion i think the real reason was my nationality, the recruiter didn't notice that i'm from an embargoed country till she wanted to write an offer.But anyway regardless of the reason, this was the most unprofessional thing i've ever encountered till now.",Highly abstract and generic OOP question   3 Answers

Amazon,"Jan 23, 2018",Declined Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"I applied online. The process took 2+ months. I interviewed at Amazon (London, England (UK)) in December 2017.","I applied to Amazon numerous times before. Usually they used to turn me down with a Hackerrank or similar test, I'm not very good at those. This time I had a somewhat classic interview, starting with a recruiter calling me, followed by a technical phone screen. Both went quite well, so after weeks of delay, I was invited to an on-site round. This was the point where the awkward things started out.I was very busy that time, and also it turned out my travel documents were expired. The recruiter was pushing me aggressively to travel to London the next Friday, since they had a hiring event there that time. I just refused to go, I explained her even if I had free time for that, I had had to renew my passport anyways. I had to submit a scan of my expired passport to the recruiter to make her believe my story (yes, she explicitly asked for it). So we scheduled the interview for a week later finally.The next week I flew out to London. I asked my recruiter if I can expense the taxi or uber from and to the airport. She referred to their principle of frugality, and advised to use public transport. I was wondering what can I expect from this company at that point. Anyways I arrived to the hotel.The interview day was quite good. I had 5-6 interviews. At Amazon each interview is partly technical and partly managerial. The technical part is quite standard (whiteboard coding). The managerial part can be quite annoying after the 3rd round. Basically they test you against their so-called leadership principles, ask you to tell about certain situations you had on the job before, or decisions you made or would make. These leadership principles are some kind of religious Amazon mantra they keep repeating during the interviews, if you ask me it's a bit scary. Anyways my overall experience regarding the on-site interviews were quite good. I met really smart and competent engineers, as well as managers, so even though there were some red flags, I still considered Amazon a possibility.The next week the recruiter let me know that the feedback was very positive on my interviews and they'd like to find me a team, because the team I was originally interviewing to was already full. After some additional introductory phone calls, I picked a team working on cutting edge AI stuff in Cambridge. Everyone I spoke to in the Cambridge office was extremely nice, but still, I was worried, because the overall engineer feedback on Amazon is at least very mixed. I asked them to wait with the offer because I was also interviewing with other major companies.Their offer was reasonable, but nothing extraordinary. I decided to sign with an other top company for significantly better salary, perks, and location, but a bit less interesting project. I really loved the team at Amazon Cambridge, so I wrote the recruiter a rather long feedback explaining my decision, and suggesting to keep in touch. The most disappointing thing in the entire process was that I got absolutely no answer, farewell notes, or anything for that. I never heard back from them. These little negative things will keep me far away from Amazon anyways.",NAN

That sounded wrong to me so I prepared for the technical interview as recommended online. And I was right, I had to write code. The recruiter did not warned me that the interview's main focus was on systems design (scalability, load balancing, software architecture and databases) which I studied but not in depth.The engineers were great, the problems were interesting, one of them required me to implement the topological sort on a DAG.A week later I was told the engineers were happy with my interviews but not for software engineer 2, so they wanted me to join as software engineer 1 level. I did not even know I was interviewing for SE2, another massive error from the recruiters.They presented the offer to me, we negotiated salaries and we agreed on a pretty decent deal,but in the last minute, literally before signing, they withdrew the offer.
