Besides, be ready for some brainstorming puzzles and their solutions. The interview is generally a one-to-one one with a 6+ years experienced professional and goes on for about 1.5 hours.Technical Interview 2: Once you clear the first technical interview, the recruiters get to know the domains you are strong at.

SAP,"Aug 9, 2016",No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,I applied through college or university. The process took 2 days. I interviewed at SAP (Bengaluru (India)) in November 2015.,"Applied through campus placement. Process consisted of one online test round and 4 interview rounds.The online test round comprised of Quantitative, Aptitude, Behavioral, 2 Coding and 1 testing question. Out of the hundreds who sat for the test, around 40 cleared. Main criteria was to get the coding questions correct.Then the interview round began consisting of 2 technical, 1 Managerial and 1 HR round, each being an elimination round. I could only give the first technical.The technical was with a project manager who was warm. Started off with an introduction then resume questions. Wasn't impressed that I was from the ECE (electronics and communication dpt). Only 2 ECE students had reached the interview stage, as it is not our major but I had a strong development passion. Asked about other job offers, why ECE dpt wasn't permitted to sit for software positions with other companies etc. Such questions I anticipated would be asked in the Managerial/HR rounds.Interview was mainly focused on puzzles. One small design question and theory question was asked. Interview lasted for about 35/40 mins.",Divide a square shaped land among 4 people equally.
