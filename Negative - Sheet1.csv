Accenture,It includes telephonic interview a face to face round and once you make it to the company. you may have to face a client interview round t depending upon the project. The interviews are easy if yu do the basics well. for java mostly interview land upto 40 min to telephonic round.,Negative Experience
Accenture,"1st Round - Telephonic Interview (Core Java, Swing, Project Details)2nd Round - F2F (Core Java, Spring, Web Service, JSP)3rd Round - HR (Discussed salary negotiation, location etc.)Had a BGC, received a mail as well i.e. I will be receiving an offer. Still waiting for the offer till date.Both HRs and Management were not professional enough. They didn't inform or replied to my emails.

Accenture,I applied in accenture careers website and i got a call from hr saying you will be having a face to face round in our office in hyderabad.I went to their office and the round is not face to face they will make you sit in a conference room and will arrange a technical telephonic round.I have selected the technical round and they told me to wait in the cafeteria the candidates who are not selected they will tell you can leave for the day our hr will get in touch with you.After waiting in cafeteria for long 2 hours a person came and asked those who have all the experience letters and certificates they can stay and remaining can leave our hr will contact you.I gave them my certificates photo copies and after half and hour they arranged another telephonic hr round where the hr asked for the salary details.Its been almost 10 days there is no response from them.The Worst interview process and there is no process for recruitment and the recruitment process is also very cheap. Don't waste the candidates time.,Negative Experience
Accenture,"Terrible process-Recruiter didnt even know I lived on the west coast when it was listed on my resume. Had been scheduling interviewers in ET and when she found out I live on the west coast, unprofessional replied back 'ah....' ......????????-Recruiter took 2 week PTO-Interviewer 1 forgot about interview and said he didnt have internet in the client site (it was a phone interview with no computer necessary). Did not even work at the place I was applying to.-Interviwer 2 forgot about interview as well-Sent email declining position as it was a waste of my time-No phone number to even reach out to the 3.

Accenture,"The process is divided into two parts (two day process):1) Online Test (Day one): It comprises of 3 sections having quant, verbal & logical ability sections..They were easy and if your basics are clear it will be easy for you (R S Agarwal is sufficient)..The result came out pretty late at night..They selected around 350/900 candidates (mass hiring) from the first round..2) HR Interview: To be honest, do not expect a proper interview which you have in your mind, because the recruiters just want the students in mass and ask anything in & out of the field and they take 5 students in one panel of interview all together making it less efficient..They selected 130/350..Basically, I personally had a good impression before the recruitment process but the procedure/company is not meant to take quality students as very basic Technical questions are asked (depending on the mood of recruiter) like what is a pointer ? What is array? So if you apply and do not get selected, there is nothing to loose..",Negative Experience

Accenture,"Contacted by consultancy firm to forward my profile to Accenture, hence technical round is scheduled. I have cleared 3 rounds taken by Accenture team, in which the third round was happened twice, just because there is no co-ordination between Accenture HRs. One person is dealt by more than 3-4 HRs, with no communication between them. Last round of interview happened in April, and after its completion, accenture didn't updated anything about whether I cleared the round or not. I got update once on telephone that now I am in offer stage but they're looking for immediate joinees, which I already told them in beginning that my notice period is 3 months and i cannot join immediately. I have been updated by consultancy (Sourceone) that I am in ""Offer Pending"" status.Few days back, I've been told by consultancy that they don't have opening in Gurgaon location, hence I opted for Pune one. Now after 2-3 weeks, I contacted directly to one of Accenture HR, and got the reply that as of now they don't have openings matching with my profile. If they don't have then why did they wasted my time. After selecting and confirming my status as ""Offer Pending"", they neither updated me, nor contacted me, and now postponing offer. it's already completing 5 months now.",Negative Experience

Amazon,"Extremely humiliating and disappointing interview process by Amazon. I am amazed for such a huge and famous brandname, they treat people who are interviewing with them in such disrespectful manner. I applied through the university online process.I got an email for appearing for an online assessment. It consisted of an aptitude test and a programming test.The programming test was about identifying possible bugs and the aptitude test was easy. After that I got an email to schedule an online programming interview with proctor U. I registered with them for an online interview. I made sure that I had a library room booked at the university so that nobody interrupts me. When I started with the interview, the online proctor checked the whole room, asked me to put away the notepad, pen and white board markers (I do not remember building logic without these). He asked me to rotate the laptop camera and kept complaining that libraries are not allowed for this exam (But I was in a private room!!). I then started with the first part of the assessment, which was work simulation. If I tried to read anything aloud the proctor would ask me not to say anything, earplugs were not allowed either (apparently, people can hear better without ear plugs), no moving closer to the screen to read anything, else the proctor would get suspicious that I was doing something wrong. After the work simulation, I was allowed a 5 min break, when I went out and came back he asked me to again show him the room, and questioned me on the whiteboard that was in built in the library room. I continued with my programming challenges without pen, paper or whiteboard. This was very hard. Moreover, when the instruction at the beginning of programming challenge asked me to note my interview ID (it said that this ID would be needed if I lost internet connection), I opened sticky notes on my laptop to note it down, the proctor went crazy asking me shut the stickies! I told him it was in instructions. He snapped back saying it won't be needed!I do not like to be treated this way no matter which company I am appearing for! This was a very very bad experience and I do not think I would want to interview at amazon at all after this.",Negative Experience

Amazon,"I've heard it's typically 2 phone screens then an on site. I had 3 phone screens, which probably means the 2nd person didn't give a thumbs up, and the 3rd didn't either, since I didn't get an offer.",Negative Experience
Amazon,"Recruiter found me and I just applied to their Annapurna labs. 1nd round phone screen is from the team, he asked about OS related question includes multithreaded, synchronization, and some simple coding exercise with some system performance related follow up. It was interesting. However, 2nd Phone interview they assigned a guy from AWS and I felt this is so unprofessional. The question is some resource allocator which allocate instances for task with resource requirement . First, they use Java, which I'm not very familiar with. Second, the input is not very clear and is very misleading. There was no sample input and output either. In the first 30 min, I was just trying to figure out how the question is like. And next 10 min I present a solution and interviewer said its not he wants because the resource cannot be separated into 2 instances, which He didn't tell me before. Then next few minutes I just noticed that the question is very hard then he admitted, the real solution is very very hard. Then he explained that the question is more complex version of knapsack problem. Finally I realized that he just wants something works but not necessarily the best solution. I asked him why he asked the question and he said it was closed to something they faced before. There is so much I can complain. First, expecting people to figure out and answer such question in less than 1 hour? Second, he didn't even check your resume, while I clearly write my most comfortable language is C/C++. Third, no concrete input/output in the beginning? That is VERY professional. Fourth, since I applied for embedded engineering/ OS / hardware, software integration, I don't feel the question is much related. I understand the interviewer wanted to come up something interesting but it just turned out to be a mess. I will say among all the interviews in my career, this is definitely the worst! It just wastes my time!",Negative Experience
Amazon,"I did two online tests, but received email last week saying there is no more head counts. This is totally waste lots of my time. I used one whole week to prepare the online tests.

Amazon,"First, recruiter show me a Senior, when I apply from Amazon.jobs to start process, senior is goon.They even take the second phone interview for design question.

Amazon,"Applied via LinkedIn. Was given a coding challenge at HackerRank, which was moderate, but practical.Eventually was invited to on-site interview in Seattle, where I had all day long interview.I was under strong impression everything went well. Just one thing was suspicious - all interviewers were young, and when I asked about average team age - they mentioned a number below 30. Taking into account they work 10+ hours a day, they definitely don't want to consider family guys of age around 40. That's my best guess. Worth to mention I was watching for people coming in and out and they were pretty young too, that is also why my guess can be right. Obviously I did not feel as I'm a good fit for them because of that.Having previous successful interview experiences with other companies like Microsoft, I can imagine these guys are looking for young slaves. Given that they don't pay above the market, I see no reasons to go there unless you don't want to loose your family or you are a single work-addicted person.To contrast - Microsoft and Facebook interviews were fair, practical and they are giving some details on where you failed (if you failed). These guys would never tell you the truth.The office building.. was simply dirty. Maybe I used to work with in much cleaner spaces in Europe, but other offices in the US are much nicer.What was good about this experience? - they paid for the trip to Seattle. Appreciated that.",Negative Experience
Amazon,I would say the most wierd and unprofessional way. They are just meant to disappoint candidates.I have gone through the programming interview for an hour and absolutely no feedback shared after the interview. I tried calling back the recruiter but just they dont respond. They are soo unprofessional.Definitely not the way to treat an aspirant and I had to withdraw my application for such an unprofessional recruitment process.Will never recommend such horrible companies. May be someday soon they might be the richest company on earth but definitely dey do have some bad bunch of irresponsible recruiters.,Negative Experience
Amazon,"I applied online submitting my resume. The role was intended to be for fresh graduates from computing-related fields. The hiring manager contacted me in mail asking for the most desirable date and time to have phone interview.The phone interview lasted around 30 minutes. The interviewer was an engineer from Amazon Research Lab at Edinburgh asking me first the questions about my background, studies at the university I was then doing Master's course, and finally, questions regarding my skills in Java. The Java part was about collections, syntax and exceptions. It was heavily Java collections questions with problem, use case scenario and a question on how I would solve it, which data structure would chose and what the overall computing complexity would be as a result.I have not been successful in getting next round of the interview. The hiring manger contacted me in 3 days after phone interview letting me know that they made decision not to continue with my application.",Negative Experience
Amazon,"The first conversation was just a phone conversation with a recruiter to talk about the position. A week later, I had a phone interview that was mostly focused around me explaining my skills and current job and it included one programming question. I had a second interview a couple of weeks later, also over the phone, that was entirely focused around programming using a site to let the recruiter see me code solutions to various problems. She did a poor job of explaining the problem and, when asked specific questions, was unable to explain what she was really looking for. After I completed a solution to one problem, she realized that she forgot to tell me all of the requirements, so my solution didn't work. When I asked her about the position, she didn't know anything.",Negative Experience
Amazon,i was contacted by a recruiter on linkedIN after seeing my profile and said that would they would like to talk about the current Software Engineer at Amazon as soon as possible.

I never heard back from them again,Negative Experience
Amazon,"When I initially realized I was going to be interviewed for this position, I was enthused, and immediately began to prepare. However, this quickly waned as my interview was rescheduled 3 times, which as a candidate provides a terrible experience, especially as I am currently employed full-time.Once I finally did have my first round interview, the recruiter questioned me on skills that did not remotely align to the role for which I applied. The interviewer focused the majority of the interview asking questions on abstract concepts around algorithms. I did my best, but did not advance. I can deal with rejection. I cannot deal with poor processes, especially when followed by a generic rejection letter, and no opportunity for feedback.I expect computer science questions from a big tech company, but the fact I had no questions surrounding the actual job skills (web development and user interface) to supplement, just seemed like a waste of time. Considering they have all my background education info and know I'm not a computer scientist but a seasoned web developer. However, it seemed that the interviewer was not at all aware of that, and just screened me generically.",Negative Experience
Amazon,"I received an email from the recruiter that the hiring manager has reviewed my resume and would like to set up two phone screening sessions.

Amazon,"Evertyging was very cool experience, I applied in the website, two weeks later they contacted me for a phone interview, so after that first contact passed 1 week for the phone interview and then 1 week more they contacted me again, they wanted an onsite interview, in 3 weeks. So I got ready for it.I went the day of the interview, everything was nice, normal questions about design and algorithms, so far my day was excellent I felt like I was answering ok, until the end of the interview, it was at 3 pm, the last interviwer was late, I was waiting for him, he came more than 20 minutes late ( 3:22 ), then he apologized, then he gave me a question, I was in the middle of the answer when he said, its ok, i think we are out of time, and i felt kicked out ( 3:28). The last interview was only 4 minutes? I think he had a load of work or other appointments, I did not think I was answering that bad, the worst thing is I think he was the bar raiser, and I think I depended more in that interview than the others.I don't know if its related, but the next day I lost a call (I was busy), from a back ground check company, since Amazon was the only company I was applying I imagined it was from them.Two days after the on site interview they called me to say that they had no offer, but they wish I could apply again in a few weeks. I did not, since it took me 6 weeks preparing for the interview, so I lost interest.",Negative Experience
Amazon,"Probably the worst interview I ever had.They scheduled the interview for a day in which I was not available, after I sent them an availability table. I asked them to kindly reschedule and no reply till I got the call for the interview.The interviewer was not nice also, first he asked about my background but promptly stopped me after 2 minutes because ""we don't have much time"", that was not nice at all.I reply correctly to a theoretical answer and I describe how I would implement a code test. Then they ask to implement this in Java, while they said on the mail they would accept other languages too, and since, even if I did Java, I do not work daily in Java I rejected to continue the interview at that condition.It was such a lost of time and motivation. I wouldn't expect such a bad experience.",Negative Experience
Amazon,"Several steps.First someone calls for 15min ""what is up"" questions. Then they schedule phone screening. Then they rescheduled for Thursday but called me on Wednesday. However, they got timing correct, I was home and quickly walked to my computer to take test.That was the online phone tech screening.First a few questions about what you did before in your life. I asked if he wants some specifics instead of whole life story and that helped to not waste our time on staff that is irrelevant at this step.Next was the problem, it was easy problem, described below. I explain exactly the algorithm as it was stupid easy. The only issue I had was that it is in a text editor and day-to-day work you use some IDE that gives you all functions of each object you use. In particular I needed to sort() and I could not remember if the sort function takes call back, lambda or something else in the language I used for the interview. I was recently working with several different languages and each has different syntax for sort. The interviewer did not like that. The I said that I think it takes lambda function with 2 args and returns true/false. He googled and it was not the case for this language. Oh well, I never met a developer who is not using Google nor StackOverflow every day.Another thing is that the interviewer was going on silent and when I had a question he probably was somewhere else and did not answer several times..Finally at the end he asked if I have questions. I actually wanted to learn more about Amazon. However, he answered first 2 questions in short sentences and then pretty much let me know he does not want to talk any more.Summary: I agree that developers should be tested on algorithm implementation. However, if real IDE is not used then it needs to be in a pseudo language because in nowadays it is pointless to remember all syntax sugar of each language, - IDE does it for you, the same way as we do not code in assembly any more.",Negative Experience

Amazon,"Amazon flew me over to interview and paid a very nice hotel. The people who interviewed me were very friendly but in a very corporate way. You could tell they were instructed to be smiley. Also, I found it a bit ridiculous that when I got the chance to ask questions about whether they felt challenged and stimulated by their job they said yes, or simply nodded in one case, with such an unconvincing facial expression (like ""I have to say yes, but I absolutely do not mean it"").I was given a document a few days before stating what I had to prepare for the interview. The document stressed that the most important thing was to prepare on algorithms and data structures and it stated clearly that no specific knowledge of databases was assumed. Well, guess what, half of the interviewers asked me about databases, so overall it did not go well...I spent several days preparing for the interview and took the time (and vacation) to go through the process. I think they should stick to what they write on their own documents. But the thing that was most annoying is that when they communicated me I was not being made an offer they sent me a copy and paste email they sent to all candidates, without even addressing me by my first name. I thought it was incredibly rude, after all the time I spent to prepare and go to the interview, that they don't take a second to make a message they send you personal. This is so below standard for most US hi tech companies out there.I'll never interview for amazon again. I heard and read bad things about the bad atmosphere, excessive and boring work, etc. but you always have to judge first hand right? Well, my first hand opinion is BAD. Ah, I forgot to mention, one of the guys had an incomprehensible accent, just to make matters worse. I am very much in favor of multiculturalism and diversity, but if someone speaks bad English, how about not making them interview people who end up not understanding them?",Negative Experience

I didn't take more than 20-30 min in discussing all trade-offs, finding optimal solutions and writing code. But the other 30-40 min in each interview were focused on behavioral questions. In the end I got sick of it. Their questions started like ""tell me an instance when you were the on-call engineer and ..."", well I have never been on-call as I don't work on a service product. Instance when you went ahead of you team scope, instance when you worked under pressure, instance when you worked in tight deadline, something that proved difficult to implement.

Amazon,"I applied to Amazon numerous times before. Usually they used to turn me down with a Hackerrank or similar test, I'm not very good at those. This time I had a somewhat classic interview, starting with a recruiter calling me, followed by a technical phone screen. Both went quite well, so after weeks of delay, I was invited to an on-site round. This was the point where the awkward things started out.I was very busy that time, and also it turned out my travel documents were expired. The recruiter was pushing me aggressively to travel to London the next Friday, since they had a hiring event there that time. I just refused to go, I explained her even if I had free time for that, I had had to renew my passport anyways. I had to submit a scan of my expired passport to the recruiter to make her believe my story (yes, she explicitly asked for it). So we scheduled the interview for a week later finally.The next week I flew out to London. I asked my recruiter if I can expense the taxi or uber from and to the airport. She referred to their principle of frugality, and advised to use public transport. I was wondering what can I expect from this company at that point. Anyways I arrived to the hotel.The interview day was quite good. I had 5-6 interviews. At Amazon each interview is partly technical and partly managerial. The technical part is quite standard (whiteboard coding). The managerial part can be quite annoying after the 3rd round. Basically they test you against their so-called leadership principles, ask you to tell about certain situations you had on the job before, or decisions you made or would make. These leadership principles are some kind of religious Amazon mantra they keep repeating during the interviews, if you ask me it's a bit scary. Anyways my overall experience regarding the on-site interviews were quite good. I met really smart and competent engineers, as well as managers, so even though there were some red flags, I still considered Amazon a possibility.The next week the recruiter let me know that the feedback was very positive on my interviews and they'd like to find me a team, because the team I was originally interviewing to was already full. After some additional introductory phone calls, I picked a team working on cutting edge AI stuff in Cambridge. Everyone I spoke to in the Cambridge office was extremely nice, but still, I was worried, because the overall engineer feedback on Amazon is at least very mixed. I asked them to wait with the offer because I was also interviewing with other major companies.Their offer was reasonable, but nothing extraordinary. I decided to sign with an other top company for significantly better salary, perks, and location, but a bit less interesting project. I really loved the team at Amazon Cambridge, so I wrote the recruiter a rather long feedback explaining my decision, and suggesting to keep in touch. The most disappointing thing in the entire process was that I got absolutely no answer, farewell notes, or anything for that. I never heard back from them. These little negative things will keep me far away from Amazon anyways.",Negative Experience
Amazon,"First round was a logic test, work simulation, and coding challenge. None of the questions were actually hard, and I didn't feel burnt out by the end, but the online proctors make you pan over the room you're sitting in and take control of your screen to disable screen shots (they forgot to re-enable it when I was done). I was working out details of the coding challenge by hand and the proctor called me out for not staring at the screen the whole time - very uncomfortable.

Even though I think I did well, I never got an email from them, even to say thank you for participating.At this point I'm happy because I felt the interviewers sounded like robots, they had this script of how one should frame answers and if I didnt frame it like they wanted, it's like they didnt understand me. The difficulty of technica/algorithmicall questions was ok, and the more open ended questions it was more like you had to say what the guy wanted to hear.It's very strange because they are coming to my country to get software engineers, then they revert the situation as if you are the one ""really wanting to work at amazon"".

Amazon,"I was contacted by Amazon recruiter, she asked me to send over my CV as they were having an event in Berlin.She sent me a link to an online test, i'd say the test was average , 2 problems to solve in 1 hour then a survey to check the personality for 15 mins.I passed the test then i got a call from the recruiter, it was a phone interview for about ( 30 mins ), she asked general data structure and algorithms questions .After that i was asked to select a time slot at the hiring event, the hiring event lasted for 4 days and i had to select one day to have ( 4 hours ) interviews.The recruiter sent me over a punch of materials to prepare my self for the interview.At the hiring event, i was interviewed by ( 4 ) Amazon employees, they were mostly really experienced employees brought from Seattle to Berlin just for the hiring event. The interview topics were mainly about :Â 1- System designÂ 2- OOPÂ 3- AlgorithmsÂ 4- Data Structureseach interview consisted of 2 parts ( personal experience - technical questions ).the interviews were above average and i can say even difficult.After a couple of days i got an email from the recruiter saying ( Congratulations offer extended )so i passed the interviews and i was waiting for the offer, she asked me for free time slot to make a call with me and give the offer, i gave her ""a lot of time slots"", nevertheless she kept stalling me for ""3 weeks""!! pretending that she must arrange a free time with another recruiter in Berlin in order to make the call.Lastly i sent her an email informing her that i'll be on vacation for 2 weeks and i'd be unavailable during it. So she scheduled a call with me the day before my vacation.Then she called me at 21:30 and said : ""We are sorry we can't offer you a position currently since we are doing restructuring and we are in hiring freeze !!!!!!!!"" , i asked about the timeline for this restructuring then she said ""maybe more than a year !!!!!!!"".I was totally shocked, Amazon has just wasted 3 months of my life between preparing, tests, interviews and waiting for phone calls.I sent an email to my recruiter and to the recruiting manager in Berlin asking for the real reason behind this, since it makes no sense that Amazon would make such a huge hiring event and bring tens of people from Seattle just to stop the process after 10 days ?? But of course no one replied to my questions.As of my opinion i think the real reason was my nationality, the recruiter didn't notice that i'm from an embargoed country till she wanted to write an offer.But anyway regardless of the reason, this was the most unprofessional thing i've ever encountered till now.",Negative Experience

My onsite interview was delayed twice after the spot I asked for ""filled up"" despite answering the email within 5 minutes. When my interview finally scheduled I had to send many urgent emails because I was not contacted in order to schedule flights until 2 days before my interview.I had the ""group"" interview in Seattle. The group portion only lasts a few minutes, the rest of the time you're coding on your own. An engineer speaks to you for about 15 minutes at the end. I could hardly understand the engineer I was paired with, he had a very think accent and was very quite so that made communication difficult. Finally, getting my results took OVER A MONTH which is, frankly, unacceptable. I've interviewed at many companies large and small and no one has ever taken anything close to that amount of time.My interview experience gave the impression that Amazon doesn't really care about you as an individual, you're just a part in their machine.

Apple,"Overall, this was hands down the worst recruiter screen I have ever experienced, and a terrible first impression with Apple.Usually, the recruiter call is the fun part. You get to talk to cheery, sociable people and it's a great break from sitting in front of a computer. I've never really had a negative recruiter experience that I can recall. Unfortunately, it changed here.Here were the red flags:Red Flag #1: I applied to Apple sometime in 2017, at least 6 months prior to the phone call. I had completely forgotten about it and figured since I was in a remote location, there was limited headcount. Not a problem since there were more fish in the sea.Red Flag #2: I received a random email from a recruiter. It immediately seemed off because it was simply an apple logo as the subject and a two-liner body asking for my availability and a calendly link. All recruiter emails are sent out en-masse, that's fine, but this one didn't put any thought or personal touch into the body and thought the Apple brand would be enough, literally.Red Flag #3: I open the Calendly link and notice the availability is anytime between 7AM-7PM. Most recruiters have the standard 8 hour availability on their Calendly, not this one. How many hours are they making her work??Red Flag #4: It's call time; it's 7:30AM, we're in the same time zone because the recruiter is in California and I'm in Seattle. Figured I'd be her first call. Nope! She ends up calling 20 minutes late. The reason is because she agreed to do some setting up for some other project, with no warning. I'm a laid-back guy, the red flags are accumulating, I should bow out at this point, but I figure I'll let it pass and take her word that she's just a workaholic with no life (her words, verbatim) and let it go.Red Flag #5: We start talking and she starts describing the team she's hiring for. Turns out it's in SF. I specifically applied to Seattle, my resume said I'm located in Seattle, my LinkedIn says I'm not interested in anywhere but Seattle/ New York, but she goes and shoe horns an SF team onto my radar.Red Flag #6: She keeps describing the team using buzz words: ""fast paced, disruptive, challenging!"". My experience in the biggest tech hub besides SF has been that these buzz words usually entail bad work life balance and coworkers who make tech their life, i.e. very myopic, unbalanced people. I'm already a bit hesitant applying to a tech company having worked at a different one with similar employees/culture, but now my spidey sense is really starting to go off! (""I don't feel so good Ms. Recruiter"")Red Flag #7: I mention how I'm in-between jobs but have some pending offers. This is not a lie, I left my job on my own volition: the market was hot and I was confident of my abilities, and I ended up with a few competitive offers within a 2 weeks and was quickly approaching offer deadlines. Unfortunately, that went in one ear and out the other because all she heard was how I was in between jobs and how that was going to be a huge red flag on their side and was asking why I left. Doesn't matter that I need to sign an offer within a couple of weeks and need to interview ASAP, she's just grilling me why I left. Keep in mind that this was no issue with other recruiters, but this recruiter was grilling me like your worst recruiting horror story.Red Flag #8: I tell her that I left because I wanted a change after a few years at ex-company, I wanted a vacation between jobs, and because the previous job was not a good culture fit since we were working 60 hour weeks and it had a lot of the myopic engineers I mentioned earlier (can you guess why I'm weary of tech companies at this point?). Once again, it went in one ear and out the other. I have always been this candid with recruiters and it leads simple understanding from the recruiters and often times job offers. Again, this recruiter had to go out of her way to grill me on how that won't fly at Apple, and how I sound like I don't want to work! Apparently not working 60 hours means not working, though I should have inferred that reasoning from her schedule.At this point she says she'll submit me to the SF teams but I've made peace that Apple is not a company I want to work at based on this interaction. I sign another offer and send an email that I will not be going forward with them.I understand it's a big company and I shouldn't make blanket statements like this, but this was an interaction so far left field from any other recruiter interaction and was so surreal, that it sounded more like a ""Silicon Valley"" skit, than a real phone call. It was so surreal that I'd be very weary of future interactions with the company if this is how the people that are supposed to be the friendly ones behave.Moreover, Apple is always excluded from conversations amongst software engineers when it comes to GOOG/MS/AMZN/FB, and from this interaction it makes sense why.",Negative Experience

Solving the problems and correctly writing them on a whiteboard whilst singing and dancing is insufficient -- if you make *any* mistakes, you will fail. If an interviewer is having a bad day, you will fail. If an interviewer doesn't feel like doing interviews today, you will fail.

They use coderpad+ a phone call and it is straight to business on a couple coding problems, there was no discussion of my resume, experience, goals etc. If the interview isn't a solid positive but not bad either, you might have to do a second one, same as first, same 2 weeks to get rescheduled, different interviewer and question.The interviewers are randomly assigned from different teams, it seems to be pretty hit or miss there is little feedback from the interviewer on what they are looking for from you. They just say thanks and that you'll hear from the recruiter afterwards. I was told it would be pretty much a same day response but it took a week to hear back each time. The first time the feedback was that there was no issue with the solution but the interviewer wanted a more vocal, step by step explanation while writing it. He did not say so during the interview though. The second interviewer seemed confused about a recursive solution and asked to have it redone as iterative despite there being no differences performance wise and his final feedback was that the second problem did not have a full solution despite him explicitely saying during the interview that since his request for a iterative solution took up more time that I should not write the code for the second problem, just vocally describe it . Both interviewers did not seem very engaged in the interview so I suppose the take away here is to always be as explicit and vocal about your solutions and try to get the interviewer to tell you definitively what they want because otherwise they just mostly quiet and you only find out afterwards when it is too late.The actual difficulty of the problems seem on the easy side, you need to be able to explain the Big O if your solutions but none of the ones I had involved any complicated tricks.",Negative Experience

There I wrote a program in python on a google doc, and was asked to come visit. I couldn't make it at the time and I called off the on-site interview. Fast forward a year and a half, and I was contacted again by a recruiter. I was more ready to see what Google had to offer, and asked to come out to visit their office in Boulder. I was super excited! What an opportunity!So, after a few weeks I went out there at my scheduled time. There are five mini-interviews and a lunch. Each mini-interview is a programming challenge, each one was like a homework assignment from a year 1 or 2 comp-sci class. Of course, the interviewer knows the questions and how to ask break the answer I came up with. But, overall it was kind of fun.Where it really broke down for me though was that there was no real making a connection with the interviewer. I am gainfully employed and I was really there to see if I could work with these guys, if it was worth the risk of starting a new job for the benefit of getting to work for a world-class software company. And the answer turned out to be no. I couldn't get a handle on the emotions of any of my interviewers at all. Everything they said sounded like it came from a script. Which I guess would be okay, but the worst part was the lunch.They paired me up with a random dude from the office, and I just could not connect. I asked about what he did, and got a single sentence about financial transactions. I asked about a generally geeky topic, and was told that ""I'm sure that we should be using this time to talk about Google, and not <geeky topic>."" Shocked at this, I said that I really wanted to know about who I was going to be working with, and asked what he was passionate about. I swear that he recited his college admission essay, and threw out a bunch of techno-babble that I'm sure was to impress me. Then I was shuttled back to the little conference room. I don't think I could even tell you what I felt right then, but I didn't feel very welcome or excited anymore.What I think this process taught me, is that I was supposed to be very impressed about Google as a brand. I wanted so bad to fit in, but I realized that it just wasn't for me. As I really looked hard at where I actually was, I saw that behind the velociraptor statue was a cubicle wall. It was just an office, like any other. The last 3 interviews in the afternoon, I may have self-sabotaged.I just didn't care anymore. I asked the interviewers what projects they worked on, and I got the same lack of passion I got from my lunch-mate. On the last interview I wasn't even writing code anymore, just some set notation and lambda functions to map over them. It was totally self serving, and I'm not convinced that the interviewer cared to follow along.I got a phone call about a week latter, to let me know that I had been passed up. Which was really nice to get. If I can say one thing about this process, it was very pleasant. I was so relived to hear that I had not been given an offer. If I had been, it would have been devastating to have to turn it down.A positive note, is that I did see people eating together during lunch, no one was alone.

I also spent about 4 hours each day preparing for the interview during the last few days. I was expecting the interview question to be moderately difficult with multiple steps; I was surprised at how particularly specific and trivial the question was. The interviewer worded the question in an obscure way and it took me several minutes and several questions to figure out what exactly was being asked. I answered the question correctly, talked about the performance implications as well as some edge cases. The interview concluded and after about two days the recruiter contacted me to tell me the interviewer did not feel that I was qualified to move forward in the process and I was eliminated.

Google,"I interviewed May 2018.The interview process was reasonably straight forward - two phone screens that asked purely technical questions. These were not particularly difficult; however explaining your solution and thought process over the phone was somewhat taxing. I am reasonably sure that my first interviewer didn't quite understand what I was thinking, hence the need for the 2nd phone screen. At this point, I was transferred to a different recruiter for my onsite evaluation.After passing the 2nd phone screen, I was flown out the Mountain View for an onsite interview. I signed up for the interview prep session, held every Friday. The recruiter informed me that it would be a mock interview style class, however the presented repeated lots of information given to me from the recruiter, or what you could find online. There was one technical problem given to us, then students volunteered and told the class their solution - this was no reflection of coding on the whiteboard interview style. Honestly, this was probably a waste of time.The onsite interview was 5 rounds plus lunch. Each round was exactly the same, 2-3 technical questions with a solution that could be coded on the whiteboard. I didn't find any of the questions particularly challenging, they were probably leetcode medium level questions and definitely shorter than most coding questions online. Some of the interviewers were easy to work with - it seemed like there was a correlation between how long they were at the company and how smooth the interview went. One guy was clearly sick and would awkwardly laugh throughout the interview. He left without any salutation and didn't ask any personal questions. Another interviewer had less than two years experience, he had two questions prepared one of which was already asked during my phone screen... (hmmm nice planning google) I told him that and he was clearly thrown off. The last interviewer was unfamiliar with my requested coding language (python) and didn't understand lots of the built in methods that were being used.The recruiter called me back a couple days later and told me my interview was ""borderline"" and we would not proceed in the hiring process. She mentioned that I was not receptive of the feedback during the interviews; however I got all the technical questions correct. When I requested more interviews, she checked with someone and replied that they wouldn't help my application. My best guess is she was lying through her teeth - if my interview was truly ""borderline"". Also, the recruiter would never send me this information in writing in an email, she would send an email and ask to call me. This was both inconvenient and sketchy, its almost as if they didn't want to have a paper trail. I'm not certain, but there may have been some kind of hidden agenda. If they didn't like how I behaved, why would they encourage me to apply again? When I asked if I could leave my feedback on the interview process, my recruiter told me that I would be able to fill out a survey that would be sent to me in an email. Its been a month and I still haven't received this email.Overall, I was dissatisfied with the process. Although there was excellent communication, I think there could have been a bit more transparency and planning on their end. I get it, Google is big and HR is huge and is going through growing pains, but I was sketched out by some of their shady tactics and poor planning. If google was really looking for top candidates, they could spend a little more time evaluating candidates instead of telling them to simply 'reapply in 6-12 months'. Unfortunately, the flipside of this is that its tiring for candidates to prepare and complete the interviewing process. If you interview 3-4 times and still don't get the job, you probably aren't cut out for Google, but I've heard of multiple instances where very qualified candidates need to interview multiple times before getting an offer. The process produces waste and false negatives, but seems to work for them.Also, if you are driving to the Mountain View campus, be wary of parking. I spent upwards of 30 minutes after getting off 237 to find parking. This is really bad traffic at the freeway exit and the roads near google.

Google,"I was contacted by Google recruiter. The entire process was taking about 2.5 weeks. I had one technical phone interview and thereafter I was asked to come for the on-site interview at Google HQ a week later. The recruiter was nice and helpful.I'd suggest eating a breakfast or something light prior starting the onsite interview since there was no breakfast or snack provided while I was waiting in the check-in area for the recruiter to come get me. Once I was in the room, the interview started right away. The onsite interview I had was consisting of 5 interviews and one lunch.The onsite interview format was typical (introduction, talked about what I've done, write codes on whiteboard (algorithm, optimization), write test cases, determining a running time of your own code) like any other big tech companies. The interview questions were difficult and pushing a lot of limit. Most interview sessions were great and most interviewers were very helpful and tried to steer and guide me in the right direction whenever I was stuck. However, there was one interview session I'd consider as the worst interview I've had experienced. It was surprising to me how Google still had a very very bad and arrogant interviewer. This particular interviewer made the entire session extremely stressful. I wasn't sure if this interviewer was trying to show off a person who was shadowing the interview session. The entire session was very unhelpful, condescending and interrogative. I've never received any helpful guide whenever I asked for clarification and tried to explain my approach. This reminded me of an immature teenager who giggled at a person who was doing things wrong. I guess it was one of those days. The person whom I had lunch (interview) with didn't seem to know (or care) anything about Google internally. When I asked about his day-to-day was like, he never had a clear respond and did not had any sense of excitement working at Google except food.

She finished graduate school within the past five years (I finished graduate school 15 years ago) and had at least 10 years less experience than I did. As part of the interview process the possibility of me working as a manager came up. Ultimately Google decided I didn't have the past experience to justify a management role. I was offered a position as an engineer and I turned it down. Why? Because the interview panel itself told me what kind of ""manager"" google values. It's pretty clear Google values ""eye candy"" over competency - which means less possibility of career advancement for myself, or even more qualified people for that matter. Then again, Google's products, which have declined in quality IMO, reflect that. This company has turned into another Boeing or Microsoft. So sad.",Negative Experience
Google,"I greatly anticipated this interview. Many engineers, including me, wants an opportunity to work with the best and the brightest. But the interview went wrong in many ways, and it changed my mind about wanting to work at Google. The on site interview was 3 sessions 45 minutes each.1) The recruiter was incredibly slow. It took almost three weeks for the on site to be scheduled. He often promised to get back to me tomorrow, then I don't hear from him for 5 days. It was frustrating working with him. But I kind of expected this since my friends who interviewed before had similar experience.2) The first interviewer had a strong accent. I couldn't understand him so I had to ask him to repeat many times. I felt like I was being rude, but thinking back, his inability to explain the questions was cutting into my time to answer them. Then he asked me to review some C++ code. Wait a minute, I am a Java programmer and the recruiter said the interview will be conducted in Java. The last time I used C++ was 7 years ago. I explained it to him, but he insisted, I gave it my best shot while struggling with syntax.3) The second interviewer was arrogant and rude! He seemed like he didn't want to be there. Again, asked me to code a problem that is only relevant in C++. I gave it the best answer in Java. He argued with me that it will not work, then I had to explain to him null assignment in Java also deallocates a variable because of GC. He wouldn't admit he was wrong, so he made a degrading comment about how Java programmer knows nothing about memory management. Then he asks a harder question basically requires putting everything in a hashmap then check for a match. He rudely interrupts me while I tried to explain my thoughts. At one point, I literally got a little angry. I happen to be a pretty patient and none confrontational person. I think he had a canned answer in mind, and he didn't want to listen to anything else.4) The third interviewer was 7 minutes late, but he was nicer. He seemed cocky about working at google. Many things he said started with something like ""at google, this is how we do..."". The questions he asked was a little confusing. I had to ask many follow up questions to understand it.If they are looking for someone with C++ skills, then why waste half day of my time. After meeting these interviewers, I recognized that my friends, who work at google, have the same arrogance. The same arrogance a Microsoft recruiter once shown me when I first graduated from college. Look at where they are now. Google is on track to become just like them.

Lyft,First round is a screen interview. Recruiter and I shared a screen where he could see my code. He explained the problem and you were supposed to walk him through your thinking process. Tried to help when you were stuck.,Negative Experience
Lyft,"My Lyft software engineer interview was a day-long five-slot interview mostly consisting of system design questions and some behavioral. In the middle was a 1.5 hour technical challenge, requiring me to bring my own laptop to complete. The 1.5 hour technical challenge is supposed to consist of a 15-minute intro/overview of the problem, a 60 minute alone time to complete, and another 15-minute for a debrief.The main negative about this interview process was that the interviewer who I spoke with over lunch. He was a depressed engineer with a flat-affect and an air of frustration and sleep-deprivation who did not have good things to say about Lyft. He basically scared me away from working there. He made Lyft sound like a disorganized, frantic company with no clear direction. He had worked in both SF and Seattle offices and when I asked what he most liked about working there he struggled to come up with anything except that he's glad he doesn't work in the SF office anymore.Another interviewer had clenched teeth and a sneer on his face the entire time, and repeatedly called out the cons to my system design without accepting any of the pros. Every system design has pros and cons, and tradeoffs that you make, but it felt like this interviewer was bent on discovering downsides and calling them out, even when the positive that I was trading for was a bigger win for the situation at hand. For example, he said, but won't that add complexity to the design? Seriously--we can accept a small level of complexity in the code or design if it increases our throughput or eliminates a single point of failure.Finally, when it came time to do my laptop technical challenge, we spent half an hour trying to get my laptop to connect to their wifi. Tech support had to come eventually, and they could not get my laptop to connect to their wifi either. It took two of them. Eventually they connected me to some other network. In the resulting hubub of having two tech support and my interviewer coming in and out of the room, the interviewer tried to go over the problem with me. We didn't really have time and it was extremely high level. So this pretty well skewered my chances at this slot.Anyway, I'm not sure I would have had much luck with it. The problem they give is three typed pages long. (Yes, not kidding, in standard 11pt type.) It requires scaffolding an entire working application, reading in input from a file and writing out to another file, converting between strings and time objects, managing multiple queues, and has an algorithmic basis that would be at least a leetcode medium (and maybe a hard). If you were to ignore all good programming practices, you might be able to squeak it out.One thing they didn't tell me is that they do provide code for reading and writing the files if you want. But it's only mentioned in one of the lines on the third page of their pages-long problem description and I somehow never saw it.",Negative Experience
Lyft,"I have friends working at Lyft and I've heard good words from them, so to clarify this review only reflects my personal interview experience at Lyft. I was referred by a friend who works at Lyft, it took roughly a week for the recruiter to contact me. Had the initial phone screen (a quick infinite multi-stream processing coding question) and invited on-site right after.On-site is when the experience went from an 8 to a 3. The day was originally scheduled with 5 tech interviews (2 coding, 2 arch designs, and one closing) and one lunch interview. The first two interviews were conducted with engineers (both nice and polite but lack of interviewing experience). The first interview question was to coding for LRU cache functionalities. While talking through the process one solution was proposed with a runtime of O(lgN) for maintenance- having a heap to keep track the LRU item and a hash for each item and MRU time. When the solution was agreed upon from both parties the interviewer asked to implement the get() function. Before white-boarding the codes down, he asked for the runtime for get(). Given the solution that was proposed previously, the get() will have a runtime of O(1) (hash table lookup). The next 15 min the interviewer was trying to skew the mindset to repeating ""is there any other possible runtime for get()?"" - ""no, unless you have a different solution in mind."" - the communication was the first struggle of the first interview. The second struggle was after the 15 min juggling through nowhere - the interviewer simply paused and asked to code the get() function out. Given the established solution the get() implementation goes:def get(url)Â Â if hash(url)Â Â Â Â hash(url)Â Â endendThen (when 5-8 min left) he finally said - is there a more optimal solution? That's when the solution was changed from hash&heap to hash&(pointer and array), which will give a runtime of O(N) for general maintenance. In this case, the get() function includes multiple steps:1. get the data if it's stored in cache O(N)2. update the pointer of hashed item to the end of the arrayIn this case, the get() has a runtime of O(N) instead of O(1).That called for the first interview. The second interview was a good experience. Even though the interviewer is a junior (he's the last min sub for the originally scheduled interviewer) engineer but he was quick straightforward and explicit on coding question (did the coding on his coderpad.io). He also took the extra time at the end to answer my questions (during the lunchtime) even though he didn't have to. I was impressed with his maturity and attentiveness as a young interviewer. His coding question is to write a compressor for text documents given the in and outs of a decompressor.Then the 30 min lunch *interview* - nothing. The interviewer was busy eating with his two giant plates of food as opposed to have *useful* conversations; I would have preferred to eat by myself. The general protocol of lunch interview is to converse with the interviewee with intros to the company and culture. No, none of it.The third interview was conducted with a fairly experienced engineer/HM. That's the most enjoyable interview session I had that day. The question is on arch design. We spent 20 min talking about work experience (same specific field of engineering so granted lots of conversations) and another 25 on numerous cases of arch design. The design question is on design for a promo code based system (with same promo code, randomly generated promo code, and promo code with conditions).When the fourth interviewer is supposed to show up - no he didn't. The recruiter did - ended the interviews early. A sign that is easy to spot, asked me if I have any questions. I said no - replied that if the interview is cut short it's generally not a good sign. She tried to explain that it wasn't the case - but I left early as well and went to grab coffee with my friend working there.It wasn't a pleasant experience for me - with the combination of inexperienced interviewers, abruptly cut-short interviews (understandable, but definitely baffled), and lack of enthusiasm from the employees (lunch chat) - none granted a near sufficient respect to interviewees. I speak as someone who also conducts interviews with software engineers on weekly basis, regardless of their level, background, or positions - interviewers should always own the responsibility for providing the time for interviewees who took their time for the interviews.",Negative Experience
Lyft,"They contacted me by email and scheduled a phone call with a recruiter. There was a misunderstood with the time, so we had to reschedule the call (I read this also happened to someone else). After this call I had a 45 minutes technical call with one of their engineers, we had an interesting conversation about the role and the company. Finally, they asked me to do a homework task, which was supposed to take 2 days and I did it. I'm really used to build mobile apps, I've been working as iOS developer for over 5 years, and I've built several apps featured on the appstore, so the task was quite easy to implement. I was really confident with the solution I implemented, but after 5 days they just told me they were not moving forward with my application. Exactly the same I read in other comments. It's fine if you don't get hired, I'm sure there must he great engineers appliying for the same position, but they should at least give you a useful feedback about why you're not the proper candidate.

How would you design an alarm clock for blind people?3. There are three baskets with apples, oranges and mix of apples and oranges. Each basket has a tag with apple, orange or mix.

Most interviewers were very friendly and professional.However, here ends the good story. A coding interviewer let me know that he is having a bad morning. The coding problem itself was not very complicated, but I could feel he is not particularly enjoying to interview. I felt as if I am responsible for his bad mood. He was constantly looking at his watch and counting the minutes instead of actually discussing with me the problem and the approach chosen. He seem to have no interest whatsoever interviewing or assessing the candidate.Another thing I was very concerned about was the actual ""pair programming"". I could tell they use it for interviewing purposes. Once hired you seem to rarely pair with someone. Thus the interview is more described as ""code while someone is watching over your shoulders and making notes on every mistype you make"". I guess ""pair programming"" sounded better than ""technical interview"". But in this case there is no difference.My final thoughts and advice: If someone is 'sharing' his unstable mood with you on the interview, there is definitely something wrong. This was a very BIG WARNING SIGNAL for me. I personally think Square is still a good company, but maybe they should focus stronger on people they choose for the interviews than replying feedbacks on glassdoor.",Negative Experience
Square,"Two phone interviews and one onsite. Recruiters were all friendly. One phone interviewer ditched me and no explanation was offered- simply had to reschedule again. At the onsite, I had trouble with one of the questions and the interviewer felt slightly adversarial. The second interviewer was actually worse- complaining about having to do interviews early Friday morning, was on his phone while I walked through and completed the question by myself (not sure why they bother to call this a pair programming interview?). Since they hold the ""pair programming interviews"" in a big room, another interviewee actually told me afterwards how rude it was that they could see my interviewer on the phone! He absolutely hated my Q&A questions at the end- apparently you can't ask them to answer to some criticisms of the company. Perhaps I should have felt it out better since he was clearly already in a bad mood and didn't want to be there, but come on! Overall, it really was a negative experience compared to other company onsites I've had.",Negative Experience
Square,"I was contacted by the recruiter and 2 rounds of technical phone screenings were provided. In both rounds I solved all the problems within the given time. However, 2 days after the 2nd phone screening, I got a rejection letter saying that the position is taken by another candidate with ""stronger match"". The recruiter was professional and acute, but also sounds indifferent about me, just want to get her job done faster. Technical interviewers during both screenings are smart and kind. However, the overall experience for me was unpleasant, since I never know what did I do wrong, everything was going so smooth until I got a punch in the face.",Negative Experience
Square,"What a waste of time!! I mean I have interviewed at my share of companies but this has to be the worst. Please note I am not saying toughest but worst. What made it even horrible is all their blog bragging and telling you that it's going to be a ""Pair Programming"". I wouldn't even mind the complexity if they wouldn't have advertised by saying there's going to be a ""Real Life"" questions. At least I could have prepared for 5th standard puzzles.",Negative Experience

Twitter,"The interview process took place over the course of ~1 month. I reached out to a recruiter who reached out to me in the past. In consisted of two phone interviews.The first interview involved adding two large integers represented as strings together. In addition there were some questions about what jsonp is and performance of some JS code in the browser that manipulated the DOM.The second interview involved listing out all the possible combinations of a phone number where each number can be represented by letters, e.g. 1 = [A|B|C]. The followup to that question involved the scenario where the number<->letter mapping involved numbers with more than one digit, e.g. 1 = [A|B|C], 2 = [D|E|F], 12=[X|Y|Z].After that It was an onsite interview with ~6 people (2 hiring managers) with one team. I was asked to implement isHappy() where you return false if a number whose digits squared don't add up to 1, true otherwise. I was asked to write the merge() portion of a mergesort. I was asked JS-specific questions, specifically the context of ""this"", closures, implementing bind(). I was asked to implement the DOM selector portion of jQuery. Debugging an issue with some JS code (knowledge about JS and using the browser's debugger).I was asked to come on site a second time to talk to another team with just 2-3 people. I was asked to listi all RHN numbers (defined as a scenario where there's a pair of unique numbers whose cube add up to the same number). Finding the longest palindrom of a string. Returning the k most frequent words in a string delimited by space.I did well on the technical aspects of the interview, but apparently didn't express enough interest in joining the company: recruiters will ask you to verbally accept an offer if your interview goes well -- it would be wise to do so.

The software designer asked the question and immediately went back to texting on his phone and continued to do so for the rest of the interview. He gave absolutely no feedback of the design choices, and when asked what he thought about it, simply said, ""There are many ways to design a webpage"".The ""bar raiser"" had one of the most condescending people I've ever met. When I asked what he does/what his role was at the company, he said ""pretty much everything. Project management, product management, development, person management"". He asked that I ""solve sudoku"", but would keep interrupting me when I thought out loud. Just as I was getting to the right answer (looked it up online afterwards), he stopped me and moved on to the next question. The second question was another question that would take at least several hours to solve. When I stood and thought about it for about 15 seconds, he said ""you have to break it down into smaller pieces"" (same thing he said about the first question). At that point, I saw that he had already made up his mind; he started talking about something barely related to the problem and started talking about the solution for solving that instead for the next 5 minutes.
