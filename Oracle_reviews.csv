None of them showed up. Set up a second attempt with the recruiter.Again, I called in five minutes early. After ten minutes of dead air, I felt there might be a connection problem (Interview was scheduled five minutes ago by this point). I hung up and dialed again. This time a couple of the interviewers were on, discussing how I wasn’t. This is about eight minutes into when the interview should have started. More stragglers. No apologies.They asked the generic “tell us about yourself” I asked what they would want to know. Manager then jumps in with questions about how I’ve used various technologies.Technical person asks some basic questions on closures in JavaScript, I answer. She then asks “what are the advantages of jQuery” I mention chaining functions and DOM selection. She then responds. “Those aren’t the answers I was looking for ... the correct answer is cross browser programming.” She then asks if I’ve ever used Typescript (it’s not on my resume because I’ve only touched it twice) I mention that I’ve toyed with it. She then really interrogated me on it. I told her what I did with it - simple transpiling to ES5 - and she harps on how inappropriate that is for fifteen minutes.After her rant, I ask “what are you really looking for?” And the answer was “we’re looking for someone who’s creative - who can solve creative problems.” I waited a few seconds hoping they’d ask an interview question based on that ... nothing. No “tell us if a difficult problem and how you faced it.” or “here’s a problem - how might this get solved?” No questions that related to what they claimed to be wanting.It’s like a bad speed-date where a snob says he’s wanting someone with emotional integrity and humor, but never asks any of those questions and makes a quick decision based on your looks.My advice is for Oracle to spend time with interviewers, teach them the skill, advise them to ask questions that line up with the company values (creative thinkers) or stop BS’ing themselves and admit they just want to hire academic code monkeys.",Why would you use Typescript that way!?

I interviewed at Oracle (New Delhi (India)) in January 2014.,"oracle App dev (oracle fusion) came to our campus. They took an online test which tested basic knowledge of ds,os,programming,dbms,grammar,apti and logical ability. the test was easy. They shortlisted around half of the candidates which had appeared for the test. The result of the test was declared after a week and a half and all the students shortlisted were to be a part of a pool campus drive to be taken place at iiit delhi.The interview process was unstructured and the recruiters behaved very unprofessionally. The ppt started 30 min late. The schedule was not announced beforehand, as a result of which most of the candidates had to wait for more than 6 hours even for the first round of interview. There was no uniformity in the difficulty level of the ques asked and the interviewers were asking random ques like write a code for solving so-do-ku or write code for solving a n*n tic tac toe. There was no uniform standard as some people were asked very easy ques like reverse a word. The interviewers seemed irritated and werent exactly polite.I was asked four questions in the first round.1.there is a sorted array which has nos from 1 to 100.there is a missing no. Find that no without traversing the full array.2.There is an array which consists of 1s and 0s. Shift all the 1s to right and 0s to left.3.There is an array which consists of 1s and 0s and 2s. Shift all the 1s to right and 0s to left and 2s to the middle.4. Reverse only the sequence of words in the string.The interviewer interviewed two candidates simultaneously. Which made the process very confusing. The interviewer seemed sleep deprived and sat with his head down during the time i coded the ques. He just wanted to get over with the process. He was unenthusiastic and demotivating. He told me to wait outside which was their code word for you have been selected for the next round.Twenty mins after the 1st round i was called for the second round. The interviewer dint even acknowledge me. He asked what ques i was asked in my previous interview and asked me to tell him about myself. He then told me to code towers of Hanoi. When i him to explain the problem he looked as if someone had struck him with a rod. He quickly explained the problem without divulging the fact that the blocks had to be picked up on by one. As a result i coded the problem wrong. He gave me this problem to solve and went out. He returned after 40 min and dint even apologize. He was in fact worse than the first interviewer. He saw the solution and then told me the detail which he had forgot to mention. i asked him to give me a few more min to code. He went outside again. this time he came after 10 min and i explained him the logic. He seemed satisfied with the logic but refused to give me more time to code. After that he told me ""you are done for the day"" which implied that i was eliminated.They dint even have the courtesy to say the exact words that you are eliminated from the process that and created a lot of confusion and embarrassment. Some people who were supposedly eliminated ended up staying a few hours extra thinking they were selected for the next round just because the interviewer used such ambiguous words and did not say clearly whether they were in for the next round or not.The whole interview experience was very bad.",1.there is a sorted array which has nos from 1 to 100.there is a missing no.
