I did a phone screen with the hiring manager, a coding exercise, and then had a full day of on-site interviews. The hiring manager was very nice and enjoyable to speak with, however, the rest of the team was pretty awful.

A lot of the folks hadn't looked at my resume before speaking with me and didn't have a copy when speaking with me. I've interviewed at quite a few companies over the course of my career and Uber is far and away the most unprofessional and worst experience I've had. You can sense they are growing quickly and potentially hiring bodies more than quality candidates.

She passed me off to another recruiter who set me up with a call with the hiring manager.Call with hiring manager mostly covered non-technical topics, largely about how my speciality might fit in at Uber. After that I had an onsite interview scheduled.The onsite was a technically rigorous interview with three sessions, it reminded me of the Google style interview process. Some whiteboard coding, lots of discussions about how my speciality could fit in at Uber and a lot of sysadmin style technology questions. Everyone I met was really pleasant and very smart.I got a call just under a week later saying that they I had done well but weren't convinced that I had demonstrated sufficient software engineering skills (outside my speciality) and asked if I could do a take home coding test. I finished the test in a handful of hours over two evenings and got it back to them. From the sounds of things the code test normally happens before the onsite interview. A few days after that I heard that they wanted to make an offer.At this point I was also waiting for an offer from another company and told them so and asked for some time. The recruiter was happy to give me time to consider other offers and went through the offer in some detail. The offer was a good (but not amazing) salary plus stock options, the stock options were worth almost as much as the salary at the present valuation of the company (according to the recruiter).The story takes an unexpected detour here as my other offer is delayed due to problems at the other company. The recruiter was very understanding but grew a little frustrated as the delay turned into a multiple week saga. Eventually the other company made an offer that had a similar salary component but a much larger equity component.

Uber,"Sep 30, 2013",No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,NAN,"I interviewed at Uber because they are an impressive company and probably a great place to work. I didn't receive and offer. I cannot say that I was surprised. I do believe there were a few things they could have done better to increase my chances as well as to treat their candidates better.As others have mentioned, they encourage their candidates to handle a coding challenge. While this is not unreasonable, they did not set clear expectations. Specifically, if you are invited on-site, they will carefully review your submission in person. I might have performed better at the interview if I didn't have to admit so many areas for improvement in my submission. Had I been aware that my code would be part of the interview, I probably would have done a better job. This is something to be aware of because they failed to mention it prior to my submission.Otherwise, the interviews were tough and tiring. The questions were somewhat less structured than many other companies.The office seemed quite disorganized. I doubt it's always like that, but it did appear that I was invited at an especially hectic time, both at the office and in the neighborhood outside. I might have benefited from them inviting me at a more reasonable time. The recruiter had rushed me through the whole process. Maybe I would have been more prepared if I hadn't allowed this to happen.Finally, they repeatedly volunteered to pay to reimburse my transportation costs and then failed to do so. It wasn't a significant amount, but it was more than I have spent anywhere else. The only reason I splurged was that, with no suggestion of my own, the recruiter volunteered to cover the costs multiple times. Of course, after I was rejected I was not reimbursed.

Uber,"Apr 23, 2015",No Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,I applied through a recruiter. The process took 2 weeks. I interviewed at Uber in April 2015.,"The process included a phone screen by a recruiter, a google hangout with 2 engineers and an in person interview with 4 pairs of engineers.The questions were different than other interviews I've been in with this structure. In the other interviews the questions were more towards algorithm and problem solving, these ones were open ended architecture questions. I definitely prefer the more open ended architecture questions.All of the interviewers were pleasant with the exception of one. I was struggling to communicate my answer, and the interviewer was openly frustrated (first time I've seen this happen, I've interviewed with this structure at 3 other companies). Even to a point of sighing out loud in frustration. Uber expressed that the interview was to simulate a regular work day, and in my opinion this would have been unprofessional in a meeting, but maybe at Uber this is normal? My opinion may also stem from the fact that I have never worked at start ups with a very young engineering culture.I was excited to be given the chance to interview at Uber but after the interview it was clear I didn't fit in with the culture.",NAN

I interviewed at Uber (San Francisco, CA) in April 2015.","Interviewing with Uber was definitely the most pleasant experience I've ever had. To describe it in one word, it was concise. It was shorter than most interviews I've been to, but at the same time the questions were right to the point and there was virtually no overlap from interviewer to interviewer.I thought the questions were very reasonable. It was not a stressful experience at all. The questions weren't necessarily hard, but they were very intentionally broad/vague such that you had the opportunity to go as deep as you wanted in the interview.There were no riddle-like questions (ones that were trivially easy once you knew the solution but would otherwise be difficult). This was a good thing and much appreciated.Everyone I met was really nice and they all seemed like really cool people to me. I left the interview very much hoping that an offer would be extended, so all in all I'd say they did an excellent job.Furthermore, I think the recruiter was on point. This person was extremely prompt, and I generally moved from one part of the hiring process to the next with just one day of turnover. It left me feeling like the company actually cared about me and wanted to hire me.After the interview when we talked compensation, I told them my current salary and what I was hoping for with a job transition. The offer they made I felt was very generous and met my expectations, and I believed the recruiter when I was told that Uber was trying its best to accommodate my requests.I made no counter-offer; from what I'd read on Glassdoor already I didn't think they'd budge on salary, and RSU's were generous, especially given Uber's current state and growth.

He almost instantly answered to my email offering to hop on the phone the following morning to chat about what I was looking for. We spend ~20min on the phone trying to figure out what my strengths were and what I was looking for, and we concluded that growth would be a good fit.I was quitting my job 2 weeks later, and am on a working visa, so I stressed them about being in a rush and to please make the process as fast as possible. Which they did.Sent me a coding challenge right after the phone call - Multiple choices of different APIs to use and do something about it; I did it in the shape of a backbone app with a ruby backend. Worked on this over the weekend (I found it really fun to do actually) and sent it over on monday.Tuesday I had a interview scheduled - they knew I was taking a plane Friday, so they happily scheduled the itw on Thursday.Spend about 4 hours there, split in 4 interviews of different types. Algorithms, problem solving, live code and front-end.All interviews were done by 2 interviewers, all from the growth team, all seems super excited about the team and the company.The interviews, despite being quite stressful, were actually a lot of fun.The fourth interview was a wrap up with the team's manager, who told me not to worry, everybody really liked me so they'll send an offer my way. I would negotiate offer details with the recruiter.We then chatted casually about his background, mine, some other random stuff and had a quick tour of the office and was introduce to random people we walked by.

I interviewed at Uber (San Francisco, CA) in November 2014.","I interviewed a few months ago for a full time software engineer position at Uber. I got the interview opportunity through friend referral.I was first scheduled for one round of phone screening that was given by an engineering manager of Uber. Was asked about my technical background, my work, as well as two coding problems. It went very well and I was invited for onsite interview one hour after the phone call.The onsite interview occurred 2 weeks later and last about 4.5 hours. 4 people challenged me with many technical questions such as whiteboard coding and system design questions. Every one was pretty friendly and walked in quite on time so there was not much break time in between. Last technical interview was a practical one - I was asked to solve a real world problem and implemented it subsequently. Before the actual coding work, interviewer had a thorough discussion with me on details of all levels to make sure it was a reasonable solution that could be done in a matter of minutes. The problem wasn't super hard and the solution could be suboptimal but you need to make it work. Therefore you better be a hands-on engineer at work and write real code in an efficient way (editor choice, API lookup, debugging skills, etc). For myself I use Vim everyday and that helped me a lot. Following the 4th round of technical interview I also got the chance to talk to recruiter and hiring manager for various questions and concerns, which they addressed very well.I got an offer next day after the onsite interview which after some negotiation I happily accepted. One thing I'd like to point out is that I was blown away by the company's efficiency during the whole hiring process.

Uber,"Dec 20, 2014",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,I applied through an employee referral. The process took 3 weeks. I interviewed at Uber in November 2014.,"While I'd love to tell the exact questions I was asked, I am sure I've signed an NDA, and also every interview is different. I'll try to be as informative as possible though.Was referred by a buddy to his team, and the initial process took a little longer (about two weeks) partly due to the recruiter not reaching out immediately and that I put things off since I was busy during that period of time.The phone interview was on filling in code for an existing interface in the mobile framework, which is a not the easiest thing to do since we rely heavily on the editor to auto complete most of the time. The interviewwe was very nice and didn't dwell too much on syntax. The interviewer went into a deeper discussion about the code I just wrote, including why I think the framework was implemented the way it was, and various follow up questions about this particularly feature. The interviewer was quite helpful and offered more detailed explanations of the answers he was looking for throughout the interview.A day later the recruiter called with positive feedback and wanted to to move to onsite. I was given options of completing a coding challenge at home or onsite (an easier version of the take home I assume). I chose the take home for obvious reasons, but told him that I was going be very busy over the next few days. I eventually around to it and spent about 4-5 hours on it before submitting, after which I was knocking my head on the wall after realizing I had bugs and what not. Also I was unsure of how polished it was suppose to be, and tried to adhere to the 4 hour guideline, which we all know is not a lot of time to do anything. Two days later the recruiter called back to move onto the onsite. The feedback was that overall I did well on the coding challenge, with some problems (e.g. not demonstrating understanding of MVC, bugs, etc), but those problems will be addressed once I go in person.Interviewees are given $200 in Uber credits to get to and from the interview, which I didn't use as it wasn't enough giving the limitations. Once there, I was put into a room (which every interview complained to be very cold) for 5 one-hour interviews. Compared to other interviews I've done in the past, I felt that the Uber interview was the most effective at gauging the domain knowledge as well as programming skills of a candidate , as opposed to most other places where the questions asked are not relevant to the domain, and in the case of places like Google, completely not related to one's expertise. During the interviews, I was asked to:1) fix bugs and add to the project I submitted for the coding challenge, and defend my implementation with a bunch of follow up questions related to optimization2) answer a ton of questions on the mobile framework that tested for both breadth and depth of knowledge (not sure how I came up with some of those answers)3) code algorithm involving implementation and use of two data structures (was unfamiliar with the second one and had to figure it out on the spot)4) OOP design question (hardest one for me by far as the interviewer wanted a completely modularized design)5) design discussion (very interesting as the interview was a debate and I wasn't sure what the interviewer was looking for)One day later, the recruiter called to make an offer.I want to mention that the Uber recruiter was very professional and moved very fast (This is not true in many case elsewhere).

Uber,"Sep 20, 2015",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,I applied online. The process took 4+ weeks. I interviewed at Uber in August 2015.,"Applied online and was contacted by a recruiter the next day. I went through two technical phone interviews, each with a pair of engineers. The questions were fairly straight-forward. Some implementation questions, software architecture, and algorithm design.After going through the first two interviews, I was informed by the recruiter that they wanted me to speak with a manager (it was not explicitly a technical). I then had a third phone interview scheduled with the recruiter. Over the course of the next week, the recruiter changed the time and manager on me five times before settling down on a date and person. By the time the third interview rolled around, I got called by a manager who wasn't the one I was scheduled to talk to. This manager seemed unprepared and was unaware of the position I wanted to take at the company (mobile development, more geared towards UI). This manager completely dismissed my design work and delved straight into a machine learning question (i never stated i had experience in this field). I was asked a few questions about how to improve an aspect of the Uber service. I responded with some naive answers about device-device communications, to which he shot down immediately and went deep into a machine learning topic.The next day I was informed they would pick a different candidate.",What do you think needs to be fixed within Uber?   Answer Question

I interviewed at Uber (San Francisco, CA) in August 2015.","Got called by the recruiter. Scheduled the technical phone interview soon after. The process was quick and smooth. The interview was focused mainly on mobile architecture. I've done mobile development in the past but wasn't too familiar with architecture details, so faltered a bit while answering. This was followed by a question on a design pattern. I had never heard of this pattern before. I took my time to understand the question with some help from the interviewer. He was quickly frustrated within 3-4 minutes and told me he was looking for developers with better coding skills. I disagree that I have bad coding skills just because I couldn't answer the question without frustrating the guy. Also, he should have understood that it's really hard for someone to implement a design pattern if they have never heard of it before. I would have expected him to move on to another question. Instead, he just gave up and ended the interview. I found it unfair to gauge someone's knowledge by asking one question when there is an entire ocean of other equally relevant CS topics to touch upon.

Uber,"Jul 7, 2015",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"I applied through an employee referral. The process took 2 weeks. I interviewed at Uber (San Francisco, CA) in March 2015.","I was contacted by a recruiter asking me to interview. In the initial phone screen we spoke for 30 minutes about my resume and they emailed that day to ask for a follow up with a technical person over the phone.The phone interview was an hour long collaborative coding session with a programmer who asked me to solve a sorting problem. It wasn’t difficult and we talked about the solution while I was coding. The focus was on me having something that compiled and ran. He was enthusiastic and polite. It was a positive experience.I was asked to come in for a longer interview of 4 technical parts and a meeting with one of the managers. I was asked to bring a laptop, but I don’t have one so we organised that they would provide one preloaded with an IDE for coding.For each technical part there were two interviewers. Each started the same – they introduced themselves and asked a generic “tell us what you’ve been doing?” I was surprised none of them asked specifics about my resume, knew what I’d been working on, or drilled down into anything I said. I got the impression none of them had seen my resume and didn’t care about previous experience. Given that, I wish I had paid more attention to the time and prepared an elevator pitch about myself so that I could have spent more time focused on the technical part.It was immediately obvious that in many cases the interviewers had no idea how to conduct an interview either solo or with a colleague. I was frequently given conflicting instructions from the two interviewers, or told to ignore something the other had said and answer a different question instead. At times they talked insistently and loudly over the top of each other.For the coding session despite organizing to have a laptop waiting for me it wasn’t provided and the interviewer strongly rebuked me for not having brought my own. When I mentioned organizing one with the recruiter they knew nothing about it. I ended up coding on the interviewer’s laptop in a basic text editor on an unfamiliar keyboard. There was no focus on actual output at all and I couldn’t spend much time sitting down writing code because I kept being asked to answer questions on the whiteboard.In a later session I was asked the question and started brainstorming a solution with some pseudo-code on the whiteboard. I was instantly rebuked “what do you think you’re doing? You’re not going to be able to solve this using a function.” Later while I was working through the code I mentioned an edge case to check and the interviewers were lost why you should check at all, then got annoyed when I explained that checking edge cases was something you should do.There was a consistent theme of elitism and “we know better than you” with the interviewer’s attitudes. One person introduced himself with just “Hi. I’ve been on this team for 6 months. Before this I was at Google.” Another made sure to mention the Ivy League college they’d attended.My last session was 1:1 . After ""tell me what you’ve been doing?” he asked “why do you want to work at Uber?” I started to talk about things I’d been doing at my current job and how I was no longer challenged. He interrupted me with a disgusted look. “I asked *why you want to work at Uber*, not *why you don’t want to work at your current workplace*”. I explained I was doing that and continued with how from my experiences I had learned I was interested in things like cutting edge tech, big data, etc. and I felt I could get that at Uber. I talked about how I like what they do and how great it is. He then deadpanned “so I’m getting you like technology, and you like Uber.” I was a little stunned at his attitude, but I honestly believe they have a great product so I elaborated more on why I thought Uber was doing good things. He tried to justify his question, “I’m an engineering manager and my success is based on the success of my team members, so I want to know what’s going to keep you here in 4 years’ time?” I was confused so I asked “4 years?” He said “yes, what’s to stop you from just packing up and leaving in 4 years’ time?” I wondered if he was being deliberately difficult in order to see how I would react. After explaining I didn’t know what he was implying he asked if I had any questions for him. I asked several in-depth questions about the work they were doing, technical aspects, etc. but he was done and just wanted to leave. He turned side on to me and faced the door, kept looking at his watch and out the window and giving short, dismissive answers. The recruiter turned up slightly after that and he left.During the day, no one said to me “here’s why we want you to come work here and where we see you contributing”. No one said “here’s why you should be here instead of Amazon, or Google, or Facebook”, and no one said “we have a great team here, it’s an amazing environment and we love working here every day”.

Uber as one of the most fast growing company, I just wanted to give it a try.HR asked me for my current compensation, and that is where the weird thing began. I asked him for opportunities in other teams, since my background was not much about money team.

After that, that hr was not answering my email or phone call for almost a day, (i had other pending offers due in 2 days), and also failed to deliver the promise that he would generate the offer within a day (it was day 4 now).

The interviewer was not too concerned with running code (it's easy to get tripped up on random compiler errors in that sort of environment) and mainly seemed to care about the algorithm. He ended the interview by asking ""Why Uber?"" and opened up the last five minutes to questions.The recruiter was very prompt and got back to me a couple hours later with next steps and we scheduled an onsite for a week and a half later. She was also open to giving feedback when I asked for more info on things I could improve on for the onsite.The onsite included five sections: one hiring manager, one coding, one software design, one architecture, and one Uber culture. All interviews started out with around 10 minutes of introductions and ended with 5 minutes of open Q&A. Every section, with the exception of system architecture, included coding on the whiteboard. Since this was my first interview and I had no idea what to expect with design and architecture, I struggled a lot during those sections. When I admitted I didn't have much experience or familiarity with certain topics during those interviews, the interviewers tended to drill down into those areas and expected me to make educated guesses (despite not having anything on which to base those educated guesses). One interviewer also seemed to get impatient when I tried to ask clarifying questions and continuously 'dumbed' down the original question or interrupted me when I tried to reason things out. By the end of the day, I was feeling pretty exhausted and discouraged and tilted on a relatively simple recursive problem that I figured out after walking out of the building.The recruiter got back to me less than a week after that with feedback and a rejection.",What would you do to improve Uber?   Answer Question

Two days later I received an email request asking me to do a ""homework assignment"" within 7 days. I completed and submitted it on the fifth day (took my time in doing so) and was notified the next morning that I was invited to their office for interviews. I was offered Uber credits to get me to-and-from the location but did not manage to use them successfully, as I was unfamiliar with the product before the interviews took place. I arrived at 11am and did four hour-long interviews with engineers from various teams, including one who is now my manager. Two interviewers merely wanted to get to know me and get a sense of my experience, seeing if I was a fit for their team. These interviews were mutual conversations where their experiences sold me on whether or not I wanted to work here. The other two interviews were largely conversational, but with one technical question each. After some back-and-forth work, I managed to solve both problems reasonably and left the interviews feeling confident. I was told the next day that I would be made an offer based on my experience (but had not yet been made the offer). Unfortunately, I was then told that a upper-level management felt my interviews had been not technical enough, and that I had to have one more technical interview (ugh!).

I got the impression some of my interviewers weren't really all that happy which raised a few alarms for me.

Uber,"Feb 26, 2017",No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. I interviewed at Uber (San Francisco, CA).","First things first. Being an engineer, I believe uber has solved incredibly complex engineering problems and I really liked the kind of problems that they are solving which was my primary motivation to start interviewing with them.My Interview process:- First interview call: Recruiter call which was pretty smooth. Company intro, team preferences, etc.- Second interview call: Seemed like the interviewer was busy with other tasks (maybe traveling somewhere?) but she was kind and attentive. A custom tailored form of a leetcode easy question would be a pertinent way to describe it. I enjoyed solving it and the interviewer seemed content and my candidature was forwarded to the second phone screen,- Third Interview call: Okay, I had a bad experience with this round. Firstly, if one is using a collaborative platform for the phone screen interviews and still not able to explain what the question is, there is a serious problem with the interviewer training. The interviewer gave me a question related to strings and didn't know how to describe the comparison criteria which is a typical english phrase for those types of comparisons. Moreover, he used to write examples (inputs) and kept erasing them instantly. It happened multiple times. We ended up wasting 10 minutes just due to do that. When I asked if he could atleast stop erasing the input examples, he finally understood that I didn't get the question. That's a serious problem if the interviewer is not making sure that that the interviewee understood the question statement. I understood the problem statement FINALLY, explained to him how'd I solve it (which he seemed uninterested in), coded the solution in ~15 mins, wrote the test cases which were working as we'd see the results, asked him after the coding part about his motivation behind working at uber. His answer was kind of alarming. I'd not get into the gory details but seemed like uber has a terrible work culture, they are just looking for programming human robots, etc. I lost every motivation to work at Uber just after that phone screen. To mentioned the silver lining: They sent me a reject during the weekend. I'd multiple offers after that and I made a career transition last year.

There is a break with a non-judged lunch in the middle.From the outset the recruiter was very engaged and attentive and followed through more diligently than most big tech companies can claim to.While this is a small detail, it was a bit embarrassing for the company: Uber offers a ride credit on Uber to get to the office. The code failed on my ride into the office. A new one was provided for the ride home - it also failed. Uber profusely apologized at the office and offered instructions to be reimbursed through the app. This also failed. Then they routed me through through reimbursement system, whereupon the representatives had no idea what I was talking about. In total, 4-5 consecutive steps failed to reimburse me for an Uber ride - to Uber. This is a small detail and didn't directly impact my decision to decline an offer.The office itself is very suburban with a larger-than-normal demographic of family types. This may appeal to some.

Somehow, I really experienced it.I applied to core infra, and somehow got interviews with money team. Interviews were very easy, and I got a phone call saying they are willing to extend offer just a day after. I just graduated from a top CS program a year ago, and had offers from some top software company and a top hedge fund, comp package were both at 250k+ for an entry level. Uber as one of the most fast growing company, I just wanted to give it a try.HR asked me for my current compensation, and that is where the weird thing began. I asked him for opportunities in other teams, since my background was not much about money team. Somehow, hr said the most obvious lie, ""Uber right now, except for money team, are looking for senior people, with 5 or more years work experience"". I insisted, and then he said ""you cannot shop around, that is not how uber hiring process work"". He also said, if I am not interested in money team, he would not proceed with an offer. C'mon, I was interviewing with uber, not uber money team.I picked one team among many teams my Uber friends recommended, and told the hr. My friends have friends working in that team, knew they were hiring junior people. After that, that hr was not answering my email or phone call for almost a day, (i had other pending offers due in 2 days), and also failed to deliver the promise that he would generate the offer within a day (it was day 4 now). I was very annoyed, so I asked my referral friend to find the hr for the team I am interested in, and emailed her and cc'ed my current hr. My hr then finally replied, and said again, there was no position in that team. As I have the info from my friends who contacted team members in that team, they were hiring junior people, so basically my hr lied to my face. He also threatened me not to generate offer if I insist on changing team, since it shows my no interest in money team. I pretty sucked up a lot of non-sense he was saying since I was still waiting for the final package.Later, hr finally said he got an update. This time, phone call was made from his manager, and hr manager told me they decided to rescind the offer. He thinks my inflexibility was not a fit for uber.

Uber,"Jun 23, 2018",No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 4 weeks. I interviewed at Uber (Palo Alto, CA) in June 2018.","Done this process twice now. Probably won't ever again. I don't know if I'd take an offer here even if I had gotten one. It'd have to be really high comp since the palo alto office is crap.Second time: Two phone screens. Onsite interview with about 5 technical interviews. What was weird is that I was interviewing almost directly with the team that I'd be working with. Didn't know that until the end. I didn't even really know the exact position until I met the hiring manager at the end (which I found out because he told me - there was no information up front!).Almost all white boarding questions - not complaining there as that's normal. I don't think I interacted with a single American in the whole process - which was weird. And I do mean American. There was a white guy in my ""group lunch"" but he wasn't from the US. Speaks to the type of people who get hired at Uber, I guess. One weird note here too: My main lunch interviewer was also a white boarding interviewer later on in the day but I was never let on to that. That's /weird/.Questions themselves were all leetcode medium to hard except for one which was closer to an easy (but it was just a question that was being thrown in for some reason). In fact, I wouldn't expect candidates to have even gotten the optimal answer to the first one I had been asked unless they had buffed up on a specific type of data structure recently (LRU cache). The questions themselves weren't important. I honestly don't know why I didn't get an offer because some of the people seemed to really like me and from my memory I did solve all of the questions with optimal answers. That first question I got - I gave the optimal solution verbally immediately. Which he was a bit surprised at but then immediately asked me to not solve it that way. I was like, ""Uh, ok... So you want me to do a non-optimal solution?"" He probably thought I had seen the problem before but I hadn't.Overall, I was not emailed anything until I emailed them about it a week later... and since Uber provides absolutely no feedback after the interview - I will be declining any further interviews with them in the future. I would really recommend you don't bother with this place. I only interviewed here just for practice before I interviewed at big N but now it's just pointless. They'll take up the whole day and you could just spend that time more efficiently on leetcode. There are other companies I can go to for similar interview processes and they'll actually provide feedback when you don't get an offer.There was an underlying feeling of racism and/or xenophobia that I felt with some people. Not going to even get into that too deeply other than saying that it was strongly felt in at least one of my interviews. If you've lived in the bay area, you know the feeling I'm talking about. Racial tension is high here. It's not new but just annoying that Uber didn't do significant bias training for that here."," Map Reduce large log files to get X amount of random lines, managing a Pool of IPs, rotated array search.   2 Answers"

Its map is represented as a square matrix.The board is filled with cells, and each cell will have an initial value as follows:• A value ≥ 0 represents a path.• A value of 1 represents a diamond.• A value of −1 represents an obstruction.The basic rules for playing Diamond Mine are as follows:• The player starts at (0, 0) and moves to (n−1, n−1), by moving right (→) or down (↓) through valid path cells.• After reaching (n−1, n−1), the player must travel back to (0, 0)by moving left (←) or up (↑) through valid path cells.• When passing through a path cell containing a diamond, the diamond is picked up. Once picked up, the cell becomes an empty path cell.• If there is no valid path between (0, 0) and (n−1, n−1), then no diamonds can be collected.• The ultimate goal is to collect as many diamonds as you can.For example, consider the following grid:     0 1 -1 0Start at the top left corner.

Uber,"Jun 6, 2019",No Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied online. The process took 4+ weeks. I interviewed at Uber (Louisville, CO) in June 2019.","I was contacted by the recruiter via phone to access my interests in Uber and why I wanted to leave my current job. I was given the choice to either do a phone screening technical interview or go on-site for an hour since I was a local to the area, in which I chose to go onsite. After passing the preliminary screening, I was invited for the full on-site interview. Since I was interviewing for the Map Store team, I was told beforehand to focus more on graphs, trees, arrays, and linked lists. The questions were fairly hard/tricky to come up with a solution in the time frame that you were given and there was the expectation that you would write your code in CodePair after whiteboarding your solution, which I was not able to do for two of the interviews. However, the interviewers were very nice and helped me through a lot of the parts of the problem where I got stuck, so I had a somewhat complete whiteboarded solution for all the interviews. I struggled a lot through the system design interview due to my lack of experience with distributed systems, but the interviewer took that into account. While I did not pass the interview, the recruiter and interviewers that I have met are some of the nicest people in tech that I have had the pleasure of talking to and seemed extremely passionate about their work, and my experience interviewing for the Colorado office has been nothing but positive."," Preliminary Screen:- String/Tree question - Get the ""boundary"" of a stringOnsite:3 DS/Algo Questions, 1 System Design Question, 1 ""Bar-Raiser"" Behavioral Interview- Minesweeper Graph problem, Spiral Matrix (Leetcode Medium), Hackerrank array/heap question that was fairly complicated in scope   Answer Question"

Uber,"Mar 14, 2018",No Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,"I applied through other source. The process took 2+ months. I interviewed at Uber (Toronto, ON (Canada)).","I did three phone interviews and later an onsite interview. The process was very smooth and everything was scheduled properly and the HR and the recruiters did a great job on communicating and arranging all the steps. However, during the technical interviews some employees were not prepared and had the wrong attitude. Overall it looked like the employees are forced to do interviews. I did not get an offer mainly due to my own low performance on the day of on-site interview. As during the interview I was interviewing the company as well, here is my take from the process.The person who was doing the phone interview showed up 20 minutes late and also at some point could not explain the whole problem in details as he forgot the details of the data structure in question. It's understandable since the data structure was a bit complicated but the expectation is the interviewer be more prepared for the interview.On the onsite interview, during the first interview which was a junior developer that was planned to be mentored during the interview but was not, after I explained my PhD research he sarcastically commented that this is similar to what he learned in college few years back! And then awkward silence pursued as I doing a face palm was probably inappropriate. The problem is not that he was wrong, but the problem is the lack of understanding that PhD is not about sending rockets to mars, it's about learning the required skills to go through piles of previous works, be able to reason and find problems that are not yet solved, solve a few of them and be able to clearly and simply state the problem and your solution and why it matters. This comment coming from a person that was working with a team of researchers along with the attitude was a clear red flag right out of the bat.The rest of the interview was conducted by more senior and professional people, except the last one. Which was done by two employees, and for some reason one of them insisted to show that he is a slacker. He was constantly blown away by the answer his colleague was giving to my questions regarding the structure of the teams and how things are done and stated that he did not know any of that. Worse, at the very beginning he was asking how the food was and the fact that he was hired two months ago and did not do anything except showing up everyday to eat the food!!!?!?!?! Again awkward silence pursued! both arrogant and slacker team members?! thanks, but no thanks.On the plus side, the company seemed to care for their employees, the HR team were very professional, and there were other employees that I enjoyed talking to.Overall Uber and I both failed to impress each other and it's as good as the case we both succeed at impressing each other. Uber already has an image problem and and their interview process does not help with improving that image."," Write a function that takes a list of ""ranges"" and returns a list of the minimum number of ""ranges"" by combining overlapping ""ranges"".   Answer Question"
