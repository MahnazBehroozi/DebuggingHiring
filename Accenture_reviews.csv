Accenture,"Mar 19, 2014",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"I applied online. The process took 7+ weeks. I interviewed at Accenture (London, England (UK)) in March 2014.","Applied online on their careers website for the Graduate scheme. Got requested to schedule a phone interview a couple of days later.Off the top of my head I was asked the following in the phone interview:- Describe the role of a Software Engineer at Accenture- Describe a time when you were given a new challenge, how you approached it and what the results were- What programming languages are you most comfortable with- Describe a situation where you used Java- Some admin-related questions such as are you willing to travel during the week for a client etc (mobility is an 'important part' of Accenture Technology Solutions)And some others but you get the gist. It was pretty straight-forward and I felt quite confident throughout as I had done some part-time stuff here and there (mobile apps for startups etc). The interviewer was very nice and was not strictly formal throughout; I was able to casually lighten the mood of the conversation every once in a while by highlighting aspects of my previous experiences which I found interesting or humorous, and this was received well. The phone interview lasted about 20 minutes.Two weeks later I received an e-mail saying I passed the phone interview, and that a member of the recruitment dept. would contact me soon to try and arrange an interview. About two days later I got a call, and the member of staff was nice but their scheduling isn't flexible. Because I wasn't available for that specific date, they had to wait and call me again at a later date. I waited about 5 days and got another call to schedule my interview for the week after.Went up to their offices at Fenchurch St in the morning, reported at reception and got directed to the 7th floor. I was then picked up at their 7th floor reception for my technical/skills-based interview.This lasted about an hour and was quite extensive and the interviewer was super nice and very down to earth. He'd worked at Accenture for a few years now in a variety of software-related roles and he was able to dissect exactly what I did and didn't know. The majority of the questions he asked were based on things found on my CV; specifically what aspects of my previous projects I'd worked on, what I had and hadn't done, things I would've done differently with the things I know now, and what areas of software I would like to learn if I were given the opportunity.At times I felt pretty grilled in the sense that there were definitely things I didn't know (when it came to things like large database maintenance, software testing in broader terms and defect analysis— a term I'd heard very few times up until now), but I was honest and said I didn't know too much about those aspects in general, although I guess I had some idea.After this interview I was taken back to reception where the same person who did my phone interview would then pick me up to do an hour-long HR/competency interview.This was basically a repeat/extension of the phone interview. I was asked the same questions as well as some others, such as:- Name the competitors of Accenture- Describe a situation where you had to approach a challenge on your own- Would you have done anything differently?- Describe your role(s) in your university project (I had a software engineering team project at my 2nd year at university)After this, I was taken back to reception, said good-bye etc and the interview process was over. I was told I'd be contacted within 10 working days (same as the phone interview). I was contacted the next weekday."," Because I come from an app development background, I thought I knew everything when it came to the technical interview. Of course, there are so many other aspects to software other than making mobile apps, many of which barely involve any programming at all. I was asked a lot of questions about these, not only what I knew about them but also what I want to learn about them. Just be open-minded, expect lots of different areas that you haven't worked on, and be honest about what you know and don't know.   1 Answer"

The interview was very relaxed and conversational focusing on my motivation to work for Accenture, which industries their services cater to, and how my skills could be useful to the company. My interviewer had initiated the session by requesting I follow the STAR approach of Situation, Task, Action, and Result to help mould my answers into a targeted response.The next interview was with a member of the technical team who went through my CV piece by piece and asked a variety of questions, all curiosity driven with a genuine interest in what I found most rewarding/challenging in past projects. He then struck up a conversation about recent technology trends and which developing technologies I found most interesting and why I follow specific news streams. Finally he withdrew a few pages of Java theory questions and asked a selection of very basic programming questions (difference between variable and class, what's the advantage of iteration vs recursion etc) which I covered in 1st year of computer science.

Accenture,"May 4, 2016",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,I applied through an employee referral. The process took 1 day. I interviewed at Accenture (Kolkata (India)) in September 2015.,"I have been intimated for an opening in Accenture and have been asked to attend the interview on the very next day (weekday only).However, I attended the interview which was telephonic. The interview was for around an hour and was fine.After few days I got a mail as well as call from HR that I was selected in the technical round and need to provide documents. At that point I was out of station with no access to my machine so I have requested HR to provide me a time of 1 week by when I will arrive and provide the necessary details.But she was very rude with her attitude and clearly told me that my candidature will be cancelled if the documents were not provided by the same day only. Again, I managed to send the documents to me by my parents and I have provided them the documents by that day without failing.Before interview, Accenture creates one Candidate ID to track the status in their portal.Within 2-3 days sending the documents, the status was showing as ""Offer Pending"".I was confused how they are sending offers without having HR round or discussing on the compensation. I have mailed to their concerned ids and got an immediate reply that HR Round will be arranged in few days. But I am still waiting for the end of that few days. I have appeared for the interview on the month of September, 2015 and already 8 months over. Then after I tried to catch them for HR Round and offer for another 3-4 times and every time they replied as that would be arranged shortly.Unfortunately after 3 weeks when I checked their portal, the status was changed to ""Offer Withdrawn"" and I once again inquired them for the reason and got to know that the open position has been withdrawn and my candidature will be processed from the same position on future openings.In the month of November, 2015 I checked my status once again and have seen that it has been changed as ""Candidature in Progress"", I thought there might be a chance now and to ensure that I dropped another mail. They clearly mentioned me that they have no openings matching my profile currently.I understood that their processing and status updation in portal is not in sync.I have few questions to the employer:1. After taking interview how can your demand get closed in between the process ?2. I have seen several openings as per my profile but not able to apply on the same from my existing created account.3. Even when any consultancy comes to me with open demands at Accenture, I provide them the Candidate Id to start my processing from thereon but none of them replied or further progress on my reply.",Moderate Questions   Answer Question

I failed the last coding challenge however I wrote it in the comments (the theory of how to do it, which was correct).Edit: I went through the assessment centre and it was a very positive experience.
