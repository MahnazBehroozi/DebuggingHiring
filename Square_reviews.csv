Square,"Oct 14, 2014",No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,I applied online. The process took 3 weeks. I interviewed at Square.,Applied online. First step was completing a coding challenge on HackerRank. Next was a one-hour phone screen. Interviewer seemed genuinely interested in my past projects. Spent first 10 minutes talking about current and past projects. Then did a coding question on a shared coding environment. The environment compiled and ran code so the code you write has to work.

I interviewed at Square (San Francisco, CA) in October 2013.","I submitted my resume to my university's career website, after which I received an email to complete a coding challenge online. This was used to determine whether I got an on-campus interview. There were two questions, both of which I put below. I finished the first and got halfway through the second one.After that I got the on-campus interview, which was pair-coding style. We implemented a least-recently-used cache in Java. It was fun, and I was able to Google syntax I didn't know, and we ended up getting it to run.A bit later, I got an email to set up an on-site interview at Square in SF.

Square,"Oct 24, 2014",No Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,I applied through college or university. The process took 2 weeks. I interviewed at Square in October 2014.,"Applied via college/university. Recruiter reached out with a coding exam, which was pretty easy to solve. Next, a phone screen was scheduled, but I did not make it past this stage. The phone screen consisted of some resume questions and a programming question based on CoderPad, so the interviewer can watch you write your solution, though you are also free to implement your solution on an IDE first.It does seem that they want people who can think of a good solution and code pretty quickly, and if you use API docs, that you use them properly by making the correct calls that are appropriate for what you want to do and that provide the best theoretical performance. The technical questions themselves weren't too bad, but they set the bar at a pretty high level for the solution that you deliver. So in this case, simply being able to deliver a workable solution isn't enough."," In implementing the solution, the interviewer did ask how I could optimize my solution further.

Square,"May 28, 2014",No Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied through an employee referral. The process took a week. I interviewed at Square (San Francisco, CA) in May 2014.","Quick phone call followed by a coderpad-based interview done over Skype. The interview consists of the guy from Square giving you the problem statement, and I was expected to write a working solution - including test cases - which is compiled and run within coderpad. I had to do two of these because the first one was inconclusive.The first problem I got was writing an arithmetic expression parser with only parentheses and the '+' sign. This was fairly straightforward. Then, he asked to parse a list of expressions instead of just one. Then, some expressions could reference others in the list (e.g. A3 + 1) which was as far as we got. I successfully wrote the code but I think he was displeased with my messy design as it was ""patched through"" on the initial design. Eventually the recruiter informed me that I need to do another coderpad session.The second interview was much like the first. The problem this time was to write a class scheduler, where each class could have multiple time slots and we need to choose a combination of times so that we can take each class. I tried this time to focus on designing it properly in OO but it took so much time that I was only able to reach one evolution of the problem - return all possible arrangements instead of just the first. I haven't received an official response yet but I'm pretty sure I effed this one up as I was probably expected to reach at least step 3 or 4. Oh well.."," Overall, both problems were non-trivial and the requirement of writing working code + tests in a one hour interview makes this probably the toughest interview I've done to date. If you're doing this, make sure you are able to solve the above problems quickly and properly OO. Use python (or similar) to save some time on list comprehension. Good luck!   1 Answer"

Square,"Nov 4, 2013",No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 2 weeks. I interviewed at Square (San Francisco, CA) in October 2013.","I applied for an intern position last spring but had been denied at the last stage. Square contacted me this fall and asked to interview again. Had 2 pairing interviews on campus that were very easy. Advanced for another onsite, this time in the new HQ. The morning consists of 3 more pairing interviews. These were more difficult questions, and the amount of pair programming vs. you just doing it alone varies completely by each interviewer. My first interviewer smelled of weed, didn't explain the problem very well, and I struggled with it while he sat on his own computer. I felt that he deliberately gave simple test data that concealed the complexity of the problem. Only after I started did I realize how I had messed up; short interviews and not much time to change that. One interviewer sat down and said let's make tic-tac-toe, and I had a blast hacking that with him in the 45 minutes time. The afternoon is odd. Some candidates are asked to do another interview, while the rest are given tech talks. It wasn't clear if they had advanced or what, and it was really awkward when they did that.Between the unprofessionalism of the 1st interviewer, the awkwardness of the afternoon, and the midnight redeye return flight they gave me, I'd say it was a slightly negative experience.The candidates are the best from the best universities (MIT, CMU, etc), so Square has the ability to be insanely selective.

Square,"May 16, 2012",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied through an employee referral. The process took 1+ week. I interviewed at Square (San Francisco, CA) in May 2012.","My first contact was with a recruiter, who was a bit disorganized - he missed our first phone call due to meeting schedules, a sign of how busy things are at Square. After some chitchat, he scheduled a Skype interview with an engineer.The Skype interview was fun, actually. Square has an Evernote-like online wordpad, on which the interviewer and I wrote code. The task was to implement a function from the C standard library, going through several iterations. The interviewer was also a bit disorganized, but was thoroughly pleasant and engaged throughout the hour-long process.The interview went well, and within a few hours the recruiter contacted me to set up an in-person battery of interviews for the next week.The in-person interviews took place at the main office in San Francisco, which is thoroughly modern and attractive. A series of 6 different interviews ensued, with a roughly equal mix of 'discussion' (read: whiteboarding) interviews with pairs of Square employees and pair-programming with single interviewers. The discussions ranged from in-depth discussions of system architecture to sketching out solutions to given problems. There was a pleasant lack of 'academic' challenges in the discussion phases.The pair programming exercises ranged from academic to practical, but the experience was good. The engineers were pleasant, and I never felt pressured or judged (despite the fact that an interview is, by definition, an exercise in judgement).After the formal interviews, I was told immediately that an offer would be made. I was introduced to some engineers and had dinner with one. A formal offer was made the following morning.On the whole, the hiring process was an odd combination of relaxed and rapid.

Passed 4/6 test cases.The next two interviews were pair programming on coderpad and Skype. Both were one hour long, and the interviewers were interested in not just solving the problem, but in having you talk the whole time. I have the feeling they gave major bonus points for using object-oriented principles in your solution (they always started typing when I used inner classes), and they let you choose your language.I was only asked about run-time once.The final interview was on-site in San Francisco, they covered all transportation/food costs. I came in with a group of six or seven other potential interns, and the first hour or two was a tour, history of Square, and lunch. Then they led us to a set of open desks where we had our last two technical interviews back-to-back (each one hour long -- I spaced out on the last one, that disqualified me).After that we had coffee, a sit-down chat with some engineers, and then a send-off with swag.

I interviewed at Square (San Francisco, CA) in February 2016.","Overall Square's interview process was fairly standard. They try to improve upon the process, and in some ways they do, but overall it falls short of what they're trying to do. For the most part it comes down to luck (who you get to interview you) and memorization. With 3 coding interviews and 2 technical discussion (and a talk with the manager) this is a test of endurance.Process: The interview process is ""pair programming"". The issue is they leave it up to the interviewer to determine how to implement that. Out of the four programming exercises I had I would say only one was true pair programming. The other mostly sat there taking notes and semi engaged (or slightly bored?). So expect more of a whiteboard session with an IDE and Google. After the coding you'll have open ended discussion with people on various teams. This isn't tough but after 3 hours of coding with 3 separate people it can be tough to be engaged.Questions: Despite what I read here most of my questions were variants of pretty standard interview questions. Design this, manipulate that, find this, etc, etc. Nothing was too difficult but they're not things you do in the real world and not something I can solve and implement while still entertaining the interviewer in the hour given. So memorize basic implementations of standard problems so you can spend your mental energy engaging the interviewer with your coding presentation.I would say my experience was fairly negative but I'll give props to a slightly better interview experience than other companies. I didn't get a confirmation of my onsite until the night before (but had been in contact with the recruiter so I knew things were still on).

I interviewed at Square (San Francisco, CA) in February 2016.","Square does a really good job on the process. E-mails are promptly replied and recruiters are very friendly. Two initial phone interviews with developers were set up very quickly. They were very friendly and we got the problems solved in time and efficiently. After that I was invited to the SF office for the on-site. 3 pairing interviews with coding and other interviews focus on more on other aspects of the company and the candidate. Most interviewers were very friendly and professional.However, here ends the good story. A coding interviewer let me know that he is having a bad morning. The coding problem itself was not very complicated, but I could feel he is not particularly enjoying to interview. I felt as if I am responsible for his bad mood. He was constantly looking at his watch and counting the minutes instead of actually discussing with me the problem and the approach chosen. He seem to have no interest whatsoever interviewing or assessing the candidate.Another thing I was very concerned about was the actual ""pair programming"". I could tell they use it for interviewing purposes. Once hired you seem to rarely pair with someone. Thus the interview is more described as ""code while someone is watching over your shoulders and making notes on every mistype you make"". I guess ""pair programming"" sounded better than ""technical interview"". But in this case there is no difference.My final thoughts and advice: If someone is 'sharing' his unstable mood with you on the interview, there is definitely something wrong.

I interviewed at Square (San Francisco, CA) in August 2017.","I applied online and the recruiter contacted me a little afterward for a quick phone screen.I then had the technical phone screen the following week, which was surprisingly pretty manageable, a really basic question. The interviewer was actually very friendly during the process, and it felt more collaborative compared to some other companies I interviewed for. It seems like for this phase they want to know that you can actually code normally.I moved quickly to the onsite - three more coding interviews, all very friendly. They helped unblock me and point out some or my mistakes as I was typing, which I really appreciate. I definitely would not have gotten through the problems if they just watched me, like other companies do. They want to see how you can work through a problem, not if you can pass or fail the challenge.Something to note is that all interviewers come with problems that they come up with on their own, not from a pool of pre-approved questions, so it's pretty impossible to prepare for specific questions.Next was lunch with an engineering manager (delicious), and then architecture with a pair of interviewers. Don't be deterred by interviewing with a pair of engineers. It's actually better, in my opinion, because it lessens bias from one, single individual and helps you with balanced feedback, if, for example, the solo interviewer was having a bad day. Together we designed a calendar API.I then interviewed with another pair of engineers about my previous projects. Just a casual chat about what you've worked on, no whiteboarding whatsoever. It was pretty relaxed. They just want to get a sense of your general experience, didn't go into too much depth.Overall, a much more positive experience than other companies I've interviewed at. Much more personable in general.

Square,"Aug 6, 2017",No Offer,Neutral Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. I interviewed at Square (San Francisco, CA) in July 2017.","Was contacted by recruiter through LinkedIn. Had an initial chat with recruiter and then a ""pairing interview"" with an Engineer. We walked through a problem together, and I got a running solution, though I couldn't gauge how well I did because the Engineer did a lot of talking which isn't usually the norm. Generally in technical interviews, someone just gives you a question, then sits there and sees what you come up with. I prefer this method of working through a solution with your interviewer. I was then invited on site to their San Francisco office.During the onsite there are three 1 hour code ""pairing interviews"""" and then two architectural discussion interviews, one about past experiences and one about designing an application(I got hotels.com as others have said on glassdoor). I expected my code pairing interviews to be similar to that of my phone screen, but to my dismay, my first two interviewers were not interested in being collaborative. My first interviewer had a laptop with was clearly working on something else. My second interviewer didn't say much at all, and was yawning throughout the interview. I thought both were a little unprofessional to be honest. My third interviewer for the code pairings was much better, and might be one of the best interviewers I've ever had. He gave me a problem, and then we talked through it first by drawing out solutions on a piece of paper, and then I implemented it. This is what I thought my other pairing interviews were going to be like, and based on reviews I've read on here, it seems like that this type of collaborative process is what a lot of Square interviewers try to follow. I wish all my interviewers followed this process. I had lunch in between my pairing interviews with a square engineer and was given a tour of the office. I had my two architectural interviews in the afternoon, and then finished up by talking to the hiring manager and then finally my recruiter. I got a rejection two days later. I could've done a little better on the pairing interviews, hopefully people reading this will get more collaborative interviewers during the onsite. I thoughtoverall, Square's process is a lot better than most big companies. I do think Square tries to push the practice of making their interviews collaborative, but maybe not every interviewer will necessarily follow the guidelines. So basically prepare to do a whiteboarding interview on an IDE, and come up with a working solution in under an hour.

We had the standard recruiter call to ensure I was still looking for work that matched their openings and we moved onto a technical phone screen interview.The phone screen was just over an hour, standard pair(ish) programming on a simple problem with the interviewer guiding the problem to ensure nothing was missed, and time to answer questions at the end.After the phone screen I was invited for an on site. The on site interviews consisted of multiple problems, grouped together by type across the entire day. I had three coding problems (pair programmed - two mice, two keyboards, one monitor), two architecture design problems (one new problem, one talking about a project from my resume), and then a discussion with two of the engineering managers, which was more of them answering any remaining questions I had, than an interview of me.There was also a quick tour of the building before my interview, a quite delicious lunch, and then a chat with the recruiter after all of the meetings had concluded to answer any additional questions and provide me with a timeline on when to expect a response.The coding interviews (placed back to back, and before the architecture problems) on site were explained very well and any issues were easy to address. Having the person sit next to you, with a keyboard at their hands as well, rather than across a table made the process feel much smoother.Overall the interview process was very quick and enjoyable (as interviews go).

The recruiters were very kind about letting me take my time and not pressuring me to move forward more quickly."," Over the course of all the interviews, I had five or six different tech questions. These aren't things you can study for, because like I said earlier, they are going for capacity to learn and adapt along with experience rather than how well you studied algorithms over the weekend.   Answer Question"
Square,"Feb 3, 2017",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,I applied through a recruiter. The process took 1 day. I interviewed at Square.,The phone interviewer missed calling me two times.

Square,"Feb 8, 2017",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"I applied through an employee referral. The process took 2+ months. I interviewed at Square (San Francisco, CA).","I emailed a Square recruiter directly since my friend had recently accepted an offer to work at Square. From there, I did two technical phone screens that I thought were both rather difficult and ones that I barely managed to solve in the end. Square calls their phone screens ""pair programming"", but it was very similar to a generic phone screen from any company - there's wasn't much of an increase in collaboration. However, my onsite felt quite different. The questions were much easier, and the engineers sat down with me at a computer to talk about and solve the problems together (which felt much more collaborative). I did two technicals on the onsite, a casual chat with a new grad during lunch, and then a ""prior experiences"" interview afterwards that ended up just being another chat about previous projects and internships I'd done. The SF office is extremely beautiful, and the food was pretty excellent.I received an offer a few weeks later (delayed due to being hospitalized and one of my interviewers being out of office for a week) and was quite happy with it and decided to accept. Overall, the people at Square seem very enthusiastic, although I've heard your experience at Square varies depending on what team you choose to work for.

Square,"Feb 14, 2017",No Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied online. The process took 4+ weeks. I interviewed at Square (San Francisco, CA) in February 2017.","Process was 2 technical phone interview on coderpad, then on-site with 3 interview with a lunch in between. All coding interviews were conducted using their pair programming method where you will talk and code while the interviewer will correct any syntax errors and give you pointers. Most questions are very practical and something you would be implementing in real life. The questions would stem from real world applications such as design sudoku or play scrabble rather than very CS based questions such as reverse a linked list or traverse a BST. Their goal is to see how you think through a problem. Through out the process the recruiter responds lightning fast with any requests or questions.Phone Interviews (1:1, 1 hour each):1) I definitely bombed my first phone interview. This was an odd question out of all the other questions I've been asked at Square. It was a very tricky graph problem where it's you know it or you don't. I first stated a brute-force solution but the interviewer asked to make it faster, I then talked for a solid 45 minute about optimizing and finally got to the result after many hints. I did not write a single line of code. However, I think Square still goes for a second phone interview as long as you weren't completely incompetent. I received a second interview invite 2 days after this interview.2) The second phone interview was really good in my opinion. It was another graph problem but I was able to get a good solution within 10 minutes and built on it as we go, I had 15 minutes left to ask questions. I received an on-site invitation 1 day after this interview.On-Site (1:1, 2:1, 1 hour each):Square was very accommodating with flight, hotels, gas, and food reimbursements. The on-site was about 4-5 hours and consisted of 2 pair programming interviews, a lunch with one of the Software Engineers, a Q&A segment about my background, and ends with a HR conversation about next step. Some of the interviews were conducted by 2 people in order to train their Software Engineers to be future interviewers themselves. At the end of the day, HR gave me a bag of goodies.Some pointers is to relax during the interviews and talk with your interviewer. I believe my down fall was jumping into solutions too fast for some of my on-sites. I missed a very obvious solution because I was thinking way too complex and only got it after some hints. I had running solutions for all of my interviews but received my rejection one week after my on-site.Overall the experience is the best experience I have ever had. I have interviewed with very accommodating companies such as Google, Adobe, etc. but Square definitely takes the cake."," NDA but they were not your general interview questions from LeetCode or GeeksforGeeks. All questions have multiple parts so if the interviewer keeps on adding features or sub-problems, it is a good thing.

Square,"Feb 19, 2018",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"I applied through an employee referral. The process took 4 weeks. I interviewed at Square (San Francisco, CA) in January 2018.","Overall, a very positive experience. I find the reviews on here that say the interview was 100% negative hard to believe. At the very least, everyone I interacted with was professional, and nearly all of them were outright friendly.I obviously can't predict what questions others will be asked during their interviews, but in general, Square doesn't seem to ask ""hard"" questions that rely on figuring out a specific trick to get the correct answer. Instead, they ask what I'd call ""fair"" questions - multistage OOP problems that incorporate CS fundamentals to varying extents. That being said, if people study in a way that heavily favors trick problems, they might find Square's more practical/applied questions pretty hard.Biggest piece of advice: get your code running.I think the most important difference from many other companies is that you're actually coding on a computer, not whiteboarding - so your code has to run. Getting your code to run should be your first priority. If it doesn't run, you need to be able to debug and fix your errors quickly. Get to a working solution for the initial stage of the question, run some test cases, refactor... then repeat for the next, harder stage of the question. Honestly, most of my coding interviews at Square ended up being kind of fun.You may or may not get asked specific time/space complexity questions about your code, depending on the interviewer. Interviewers were all friendly, and helped unblock me if I got too stuck for too long. They kept things moving.The post-interview experience was very positive, too. Things moved quickly - I heard back within a couple days - and the team selection, offer, and negotiation all went pretty smoothly.

When I asked for information, the recruiter promptly provided the information in the form of email or Linkedin direct message. We scheduled the first round of the technical interviews which was done virtually through coderpad + any language I wished to use. The interview was described as a pair programming experience.My technical interviewer called right on time and we got started working on the problem. My interviewer explained the problem with enough context for me to briefly explain it back, including what I thought were some corner cases.The interview was scheduled for an hour so I worked on getting a working solution first, and emphasized in a few places how I would optimize later if we had the time. I made sure to cover the cases he wanted covering.

Square,"Feb 4, 2014",No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 2 weeks. I interviewed at Square (San Francisco, CA) in February 2014.",Had two phone interviews which are coding on a shared document and they were pretty easy. And was flew in to their SF headquarter for the onsite. I had three paired coding interviews and finished all the requirements and tests ahead of time. And then I had three Q&A interviews focusing on past experiences and a lot of behavior questions. They seem to be happy with my answers. In general I feel they like me. However I just got a rejection email from the recruiting team saying that my coding was not good enough and they are on the edge of accepting but in the end decide to pass.,To me nothing feels really difficult. But I guess I know how high their bar is this time. Getting the coding questions done correctly ahead of time doesn't assure you that you will pass. It only guarantees you that they will let you finish the whole schedule which means meeting everyone you are supposed to meet. Maybe they judge people with a few more years of experiences with a much higher standard. Some people I interviewed with are founding members of some big names in the Bay area.   Answer Question
Square,"Dec 8, 2014",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,NAN,"Two phone interviews and one onsite. Recruiters were all friendly. One phone interviewer ditched me and no explanation was offered- simply had to reschedule again. At the onsite, I had trouble with one of the questions and the interviewer felt slightly adversarial. The second interviewer was actually worse- complaining about having to do interviews early Friday morning, was on his phone while I walked through and completed the question by myself (not sure why they bother to call this a pair programming interview?). Since they hold the ""pair programming interviews"" in a big room, another interviewee actually told me afterwards how rude it was that they could see my interviewer on the phone! He absolutely hated my Q&A questions at the end- apparently you can't ask them to answer to some criticisms of the company. Perhaps I should have felt it out better since he was clearly already in a bad mood and didn't want to be there, but come on!

I was contacted by the recruiter and was told there would be two phone screens.I had a phone screen which involved two graph traversal based coding problems. I would say medium difficulty. There was no talk about my resume or background. The coding went pretty wellAfter the phone screen I was called onsite (I had just one phone screen). When I did get called though, they told me they were interviewing for a Software engineer role and not a senior engineer role.There were 3 technical coding interviews on Mac, on an IDE of your choice. One casual lunch meeting. One resume based interview and one design interview. Then there is a 30 min conversation with the hiring manager.I felt I had aced the coding rounds with a working solution to all their sub problems. In the resume based round there were two fresh out of college graduates (kids) and I got a feeling they had no clue what I was talking about. They asked pretty much no questions at all. This was a chance for me impress which I lost.In the design round it was hard to say what happened. They went into detail on one part of the system and we kept talking about that and didn't cover much ground. May be they expected me to take charge instead of letting them control the direction. The conversation with the manager was very informative.On the third day after the interview I got a canned rejection email which said something like we don't want you but we are sure you have other options. I asked for a feedback and there was none.Overall I would say the interviewers very nice and supportive. But it's hard to say what exactly are they looking for.

I interviewed at Square in April 2019.,"One phone HR interview, than the process was 2 phone technical interviews followed by on-site interview. Did not make it past 1st technical phone interview.

Just a basic string parse question, print the output to the screen. You have 60mins. Easy question, however, the interviewer called 5 mins late, than talked about himself for next 10, than dove into the question at the 15 min mark. You can chose the language, I chose Java. Interviewer didn't know Java to well, which was fine. My problem came with understanding the question. You have to create your own input, your own tests, and the actual algorithm which is great, however when you ask questions to help your understanding of what he wants and his response is ""I don't know"" that can make for a bad interview. I spent the next 15 min trying to figure out exactly what he wanted but rewording half my questions because he didnt have the answers. For example, asked how the data was to be presented, he said he didnt know. Should I store the output or print it to the screen, I dont know, Yeah I guess you can print it.
