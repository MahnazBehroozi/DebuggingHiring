Lyft,"Mar 30, 2016",Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"I applied online. The process took 3 weeks. I interviewed at Lyft (San Francisco, CA) in March 2016.","I applied online and was contacted by a recruiter on the same day. He briefly went over the teams and the interview process, which consists of 1-2 1hr technical screens and a full day onsite. We scheduled the technical screen for the following week. For the technical screen, you have the option of visiting their office and doing it onsite, which I'd highly recommend; interviews over the phone and coderpad at awkward at best because of the lack of face-to-face interaction and it was also a great opportunity to check out the office and culture before getting too deep into the interview process.The technical screen itself was fairly straightforward and the recruiter was very open about what topics to expect. CS fundamentals and good communication were key. The recruiter got back to me with results the next day and we scheduled an onsite for two weeks later (because of conflicts on my end).Again, the recruiter was extremely helpful in setting expectations for the onsite; he hopped on a call with me a week before to go over the teams and engineers I'd be meeting with as well as specific feedback from my screen. It consisted of four technical sections (two design, two coding), lunch, and a chat with a hiring manager. Everyone I spoke to was smart, friendly, and easy to work with and I received a verbal offer just hours later.This was definitely the most positive interview experience I've gone through. There were no egos or weird power plays during the interview or negotiation process and I definitely felt like the recruiter was trying to set me up for success.",Design a coupon system.   2 Answers
Lyft,"Oct 31, 2015",No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,I applied online. The process took 4 weeks. I interviewed at Lyft in October 2015.,"Was contacted by a recruiter about a week after applying online for an iOS position. Set up a quick 30 minute call but she got the time zone wrong, so we had to reschedule. After the recruiter call, did a short technical call with an engineer. The technical interview had very little in the way of coding, just asking questions about my development style. After that the recruiter wanted me to complete a ""short"" programming assignment. I pushed back since I hate doing these but they told me it was part of their process.I spent a good 8 hours building a ""small"" app (they told me to send it within 2 days). A few days after submitting the app, I got a form rejection email and no contact since. My experience is similar to another interviewee on Glassdoor who I should've paid attention to. While the app I wrote was not perfect, I have no way of knowing what it was lacking, and literally spent hours on it for no reason. Companies that require candidates to do this before an onsite just come off as lazy as it requires no extra work for them and a lot of extra work for the candidates.My suggestion is an emphatic DO NOT APPLY FOR A JOB AT LYFT. It is not worth your time. There are better companies out there that require fewer hoops to jump through and actually treat the candidates with respect."," General questions about iOS frameworks, language features.   Answer Question"

Lyft,"Nov 24, 2015",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"I applied through an employee referral. I interviewed at Lyft (San Francisco, CA) in November 2015.","I have friends working at Lyft and I've heard good words from them, so to clarify this review only reflects my personal interview experience at Lyft. I was referred by a friend who works at Lyft, it took roughly a week for the recruiter to contact me. Had the initial phone screen (a quick infinite multi-stream processing coding question) and invited on-site right after.On-site is when the experience went from an 8 to a 3. The day was originally scheduled with 5 tech interviews (2 coding, 2 arch designs, and one closing) and one lunch interview. The first two interviews were conducted with engineers (both nice and polite but lack of interviewing experience). The first interview question was to coding for LRU cache functionalities. While talking through the process one solution was proposed with a runtime of O(lgN) for maintenance- having a heap to keep track the LRU item and a hash for each item and MRU time. When the solution was agreed upon from both parties the interviewer asked to implement the get() function. Before white-boarding the codes down, he asked for the runtime for get(). Given the solution that was proposed previously, the get() will have a runtime of O(1) (hash table lookup). The next 15 min the interviewer was trying to skew the mindset to repeating ""is there any other possible runtime for get()?"" - ""no, unless you have a different solution in mind."" - the communication was the first struggle of the first interview. The second struggle was after the 15 min juggling through nowhere - the interviewer simply paused and asked to code the get() function out. Given the established solution the get() implementation goes:def get(url)  if hash(url)    hash(url)  endendThen (when 5-8 min left) he finally said - is there a more optimal solution? That's when the solution was changed from hash&heap to hash&(pointer and array), which will give a runtime of O(N) for general maintenance. In this case, the get() function includes multiple steps:1. get the data if it's stored in cache O(N)2. update the pointer of hashed item to the end of the arrayIn this case, the get() has a runtime of O(N) instead of O(1).That called for the first interview. The second interview was a good experience. Even though the interviewer is a junior (he's the last min sub for the originally scheduled interviewer) engineer but he was quick straightforward and explicit on coding question (did the coding on his coderpad.io). He also took the extra time at the end to answer my questions (during the lunchtime) even though he didn't have to. I was impressed with his maturity and attentiveness as a young interviewer. His coding question is to write a compressor for text documents given the in and outs of a decompressor.Then the 30 min lunch *interview* - nothing. The interviewer was busy eating with his two giant plates of food as opposed to have *useful* conversations; I would have preferred to eat by myself. The general protocol of lunch interview is to converse with the interviewee with intros to the company and culture. No, none of it.The third interview was conducted with a fairly experienced engineer/HM. That's the most enjoyable interview session I had that day. The question is on arch design. We spent 20 min talking about work experience (same specific field of engineering so granted lots of conversations) and another 25 on numerous cases of arch design. The design question is on design for a promo code based system (with same promo code, randomly generated promo code, and promo code with conditions).When the fourth interviewer is supposed to show up - no he didn't. The recruiter did - ended the interviews early. A sign that is easy to spot, asked me if I have any questions. I said no - replied that if the interview is cut short it's generally not a good sign. She tried to explain that it wasn't the case - but I left early as well and went to grab coffee with my friend working there.It wasn't a pleasant experience for me - with the combination of inexperienced interviewers, abruptly cut-short interviews (understandable, but definitely baffled), and lack of enthusiasm from the employees (lunch chat) - none granted a near sufficient respect to interviewees. I speak as someone who also conducts interviews with software engineers on weekly basis, regardless of their level, background, or positions - interviewers should always own the responsibility for providing the time for interviewees who took their time for the interviews.",Compressor and decompressor   1 Answer

Lyft,"Jan 28, 2016",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 2 weeks. I interviewed at Lyft (San Francisco, CA) in January 2016.","They contacted me by email and scheduled a phone call with a recruiter. There was a misunderstood with the time, so we had to reschedule the call (I read this also happened to someone else). After this call I had a 45 minutes technical call with one of their engineers, we had an interesting conversation about the role and the company. Finally, they asked me to do a homework task, which was supposed to take 2 days and I did it. I'm really used to build mobile apps, I've been working as iOS developer for over 5 years, and I've built several apps featured on the appstore, so the task was quite easy to implement. I was really confident with the solution I implemented, but after 5 days they just told me they were not moving forward with my application. Exactly the same I read in other comments. It's fine if you don't get hired, I'm sure there must he great engineers appliying for the same position, but they should at least give you a useful feedback about why you're not the proper candidate.

She got back to me and we set up a chat where we talked about my background, why I wanted to work at Lyft, etc. I then went through 2 technical phone interviews where the format was pretty typical: 5-10 minutes of introductions, 30-40 minutes of technical question(s), 5-10 minutes of asking questions about the position/company. I made it to onsite interviews where the format was: tour of the office, 2 technical interviews, lunch with an engineer, 1 technical interview, and a 30 minute interview with an engineering manager.Overall, the process was very enjoyable and probably the best I've ever gone through.

Well then why did he say my solution was ok in the first place?",Design a Coupon system   Answer Question
Lyft,"Aug 7, 2018",No Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,"I applied through an employee referral. I interviewed at Lyft (San Francisco, CA) in July 2018.","The recruiter was almost MIA in the process as I never met her and had multiple points of contact through the process and she was also poorly responsive throughout.

I was greeted with two incredible cheerful people from recruiting staff (not the main recruiter of course) and every person I met on the day of the onsite interviews were polite and professional. I was rejected after I reached out more than a week later and needed to make a decision as I had received an offer elsewhere.

I interviewed at Lyft (San Francisco, CA) in July 2018.","I submitted an application through a referral. Had a nice initial chat with one of the hiring managers where I was given an overview of the team I was applying to.From there I had a phone technical interview with a software engineer on the team I was applying to. It was apparent from the get-go that the engineer wasn't interested in me from him primarily asking about things on my resume that he didn't like. The engineer didn't work with me very much with solving the technical problem, mostly just staying silent as I talked through the problem and workshopping possible solutions. His english was very hard to understand, and I'm wondering if that contributed to his inability to collaborate on the problem.Either way, it was a poor interview and I didn't move on from there.

I thought the call went OK, but Lyft did not want to move forward. To their credit, the recruiter did share the interviewer's feedback with me, but the negative parts of the feedback did seem fairly trivial, especially for an on-the-spot coding exercise.

Lyft,"Oct 7, 2018",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"I applied through an employee referral. The process took a week. I interviewed at Lyft (New York, NY) in June 2018.","Recruiter is very blunt and efficient. Was probably going down a checklist as he was speaking to me. Not personable, but that's fine. I had an initial phone screen on coderpad. The first interviewer was nice. I got a very simple problem, but I couldn't figure out how to compile the code on coderpad using the language of my choice. I advise to figure out how to use coderpad beforehand to avoid wasting time. Because of the time I wasted, couldn't get to the last part of the problem. They scheduled a second phone interview because of that.Second phone interview went pretty badly, which attribute one part to me and one part to the interviewer. The interviewer was incredibly arrogant and stubborn. I was coming up with a solution that would have been the same time complexity, but more space than the solution the interviewer wanted. The interviewer kept telling me to abandon my solution instead of letting me explore it and forced me to try to think of the interviewer's solution instead. Never encountered an interviewer before that only wanted one solution even though the problem has like 4. I'm sure those kind of interviewers are out there, but this was just my first time encountering one. Overall, pretty bad and inexperienced interviewer that was hard to communicate with. On my part, maybe I was just too stupid to understand the one particular solution the interviewer wanted.",Leetcode questions/classic questions   Answer Question

Lyft,"Dec 31, 2018",No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"I applied through an employee referral. The process took 4+ weeks. I interviewed at Lyft (Seattle, WA) in October 2018.","My Lyft software engineer interview was a day-long five-slot interview mostly consisting of system design questions and some behavioral. In the middle was a 1.5 hour technical challenge, requiring me to bring my own laptop to complete. The 1.5 hour technical challenge is supposed to consist of a 15-minute intro/overview of the problem, a 60 minute alone time to complete, and another 15-minute for a debrief.The main negative about this interview process was that the interviewer who I spoke with over lunch. He was a depressed engineer with a flat-affect and an air of frustration and sleep-deprivation who did not have good things to say about Lyft. He basically scared me away from working there. He made Lyft sound like a disorganized, frantic company with no clear direction. He had worked in both SF and Seattle offices and when I asked what he most liked about working there he struggled to come up with anything except that he's glad he doesn't work in the SF office anymore.Another interviewer had clenched teeth and a sneer on his face the entire time, and repeatedly called out the cons to my system design without accepting any of the pros. Every system design has pros and cons, and tradeoffs that you make, but it felt like this interviewer was bent on discovering downsides and calling them out, even when the positive that I was trading for was a bigger win for the situation at hand. For example, he said, but won't that add complexity to the design? Seriously--we can accept a small level of complexity in the code or design if it increases our throughput or eliminates a single point of failure.Finally, when it came time to do my laptop technical challenge, we spent half an hour trying to get my laptop to connect to their wifi. Tech support had to come eventually, and they could not get my laptop to connect to their wifi either. It took two of them. Eventually they connected me to some other network. In the resulting hubub of having two tech support and my interviewer coming in and out of the room, the interviewer tried to go over the problem with me. We didn't really have time and it was extremely high level. So this pretty well skewered my chances at this slot.Anyway, I'm not sure I would have had much luck with it. The problem they give is three typed pages long. (Yes, not kidding, in standard 11pt type.) It requires scaffolding an entire working application, reading in input from a file and writing out to another file, converting between strings and time objects, managing multiple queues, and has an algorithmic basis that would be at least a leetcode medium (and maybe a hard). If you were to ignore all good programming practices, you might be able to squeak it out.One thing they didn't tell me is that they do provide code for reading and writing the files if you want. But it's only mentioned in one of the lines on the third page of their pages-long problem description and I somehow never saw it.",Protected by NDA   Answer Question
Lyft,"Jan 25, 2019",No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,"I applied through an employee referral. The process took 3 weeks. I interviewed at Lyft (San Francisco, CA) in January 2019.","The feedback that I got from the interview doesn't align with my performance in the interview. For the laptop coding test, I was told that I didn't add any comment/explanation for optimization which is completely false. I tried to explain this to the interviewer but they were not super interested in hearing that and asked me to add it as a comment which I did. The Javadoc comment for optimization was pretty clear in my opinion and the complexity of this algorithm was strong enough to solve the constraint stated in the problem (nlogn for 10^5 data-points). The initial debriefing took about 25-30 minutes instead of the allocated 15 minutes because the interviewers struggled to resolve confusion that I had regarding one of the test cases. Due to this, there wasn't enough room at the end and we left in a hurry.In the CS fundamentals interview, it was stated that my solution had a memory leak. But we were dealing with about 40 or so data points, so practically it becomes difficult to see memory leak in such scenarios. A better hint from the interviewer might be to ask if such a solution would lead to any potential problem at a bigger scale or not. Apart from this, the interviewer informed that the solution had this problem rather than asking if the solution had any potential problems.",NAN
